            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>And the LORD called unto</hi> Moſes.] That is, bad him draw near, and not be afraid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Glory of that Light which was in the Tabernacle, (XL <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.) For this is a word of <hi>love,</hi> as the Hebrew Doctors ſpeak: who obſerve, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52830:4"/>God is not ſaid to call the Prophets of the Gentiles; but we only read that God <hi>jikar met Balaam;</hi> not <hi>jikra</hi> called to him, as he did here to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Who, as <hi>Procopius Gazaeus</hi> hath well obſerved, upon this word, appointed no Service of God, in his Houſe which he had lately erected, without his order: whereas the Worſhip performed in the honour of <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> was without any Authority from him. Nay, there were Magical Operations in it, and Invocation of Daemons; and certain tacit Obligations which their Prieſts contracted with them. For which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces <hi>Porphyry</hi> as a Witneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſpake unto him but of the Tabernacle.]</hi> Hitherto he had ſpoken to him out of Heaven, or out of the Cloud; but now out of his own Houſe. Into which, it is not here ſaid he bad him come, (as he did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when the Glory of the LORD dwelt only in the inner part of the Houſe, over the Ark) but he ſtood, it is likely, without the Door of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, till the Sacrifices were appointed (as it here follows) and the High Prieſt entred into it with the Blood of Expiation. I can find no time, in which this can ſo probably be ſuppoſed to have been done, as immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the Conſecration of the Tabernacle, as ſoon as the Glory of the LORD entred into it. And ſo I find <hi>Heſychius</hi> underſtood it, who obſerving this Book to begin with the word <hi>And,</hi> which is a Conjunction uſed to joyn what follows with that which goes before, thence concludes that the beginning of this Book is knit to the concluſion of the laſt; and conſequently what is here related was ſpoken to <hi>Moſes</hi> on the ſame day he had ſet up the Tabernacle, and the Glory of the LORD filled it. When <hi>Moſes</hi> might well think (as the <hi>Hieruſalem Targum</hi> explains it) that if Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was ſo exalted, by the Divine Preſence there for a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52830:4"/>ſhort ſpace, that it was not ſafe for him to approach it, much leſs come up into it, till God commanded him; he had much more reaſon not to go into the Tabernacle, which was ſanctified to be God's dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place for ever, till God called to him by a Voice from his Preſence: nay, he durſt not ſo much as come near the Door, where I ſuppoſe he now ſtood, without a particular Direction from the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>

                  <hi>Speak unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.]</hi> The Tabernacle being erected, it was fit, in the next place, to appoint the Service that ſhould be performed in it: which conſiſted in ſuch Sacrifices as are here mentioned in the beginning of this Book. There could not be a more Natural order, in ſetting down the Laws delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> than this which is here obſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any man of you bring.]</hi> It is the Obſervation of <hi>Kimchi,</hi> that in the very beginning of the Laws about Sacrifices, God doth not require them to offer any, but only ſuppoſes they would; having been long accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to it, as all the World then was. To this he applys the words of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> VII. 21. and takes it for an Indication, that otherwiſe God would not have given ſo many Laws concerning Sacrifices, but only in compliance with the uſage of the World; which could not then have been quite broken, without the hazard of a Revolt from him. And therefore they are directed to the right Object, the Eternal God; and limited to ſuch things, as were moſt agreeable to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An offering unto the LORD.]</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Korban,</hi> which we tranſlate an <hi>Offering,</hi> and the Greeks tranſlate a <hi>Gift,</hi> is larger than <hi>Zebach,</hi> which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> For as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> obſerves in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52830:5"/>to this Book; though every <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, yet every <hi>Offering</hi> was not a Sacrifice. A <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> being an Offering that was ſlain; but there were ſeveral <hi>Offerings</hi> of inanimate things (as thoſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the beginning of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Chapter of this Book) which therefore were not properly Sacrifices; but were accepted of God as much as the Offering of Beaſts, when they had nothing better to give. And therefore the ſame <hi>Abarbinel</hi> will have the Name of <hi>Korban</hi> to be given to theſe Offerings, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Men approached to God. For it is derived from a word which ſignifies to <hi>draw near:</hi> from whence he thinks thoſe words in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> IV. 7. <hi>What Nation is there that hath God ſo nigh unto them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye ſhall bring.]</hi> He ſpeaks in the Plural Number, ſay ſome of the Hebrew Doctors, (who have accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately conſidered theſe things) to ſhow that two Men might joyn together to offer one thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your offering of the Cattle.]</hi> I do not know what ground <hi>Maimonides</hi> had to aſſert in his <hi>More Nevochim. Pars</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 46. that the Heathen in thoſe days had brute Beaſts in great veneration, and would not kill them (for it is no Argument there was ſuch a Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, becauſe there were People in the days of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> as there are now, who were poſſeſſed with ſuch Opinions). But he thinks God intended to deſtroy this falſe Perſwaſion, by requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Jews to offer ſuch Beaſts as are here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that what the Heathen thought it a great ſin to kill, might be offered to God, and thereby Mens ſins be expiated. By this means, ſaith he, Mens evil Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which are the Diſeaſes and Ulcers of the Mind, were cured; as Bodily Diſeaſes are by their contraries. Yet in the XXXII Chapter of that Book, he ſaith God ordered Sacrifices to be offered, that he might not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52830:5"/>wholly alter the Cuſtoms of Mankind, who built Temples and offered Sacrifices every where: taking care (it may be added) at the ſame time, that they ſhould be offered only to himſelf, at one certain place, and after ſuch a manner, as to preſerve his People from all Idolatrous Rites. Which if they had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, who contemned this Book of LEVITICUS (as <hi>Procopius Gazaeus</hi> tells us ſome did) becauſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated too much of Sacrifices, they would not have thought it unworthy of the Creator of the World, eſpecially if they had lookt further to the Wiſdom hidden under theſe things; which were <hi>Examples, Shadows, and Patterns of heavenly things,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks VIII <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. IX. 13. And ſo was the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle it ſelf, <hi>a Figure,</hi> (as we there read <hi>v.</hi> 9.) <hi>for the time preſent, of a greater and more perfect Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, not made with hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Even of the herd and of the flock.]</hi> That is, Bullocks, Sheep, and Goats. For under the word <hi>tzon</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>Flock</hi>) both <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> expounds himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 10. Theſe were the principal Sacrifices, and moſt acceptable to God, as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> obſerves in the fore-named place. For though <hi>Doves</hi> and <hi>Turtles</hi> were accepted when Men were not able to bring the other; yet in Publick Sacrifices theſe Birds were never allowed: but only the three ſorts of four-footed Beaſts before-mentioned. Which were therefore choſen (as he proceeds) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe were the moſt-excellent of all-brute Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, on ſeveral accounts; and becauſe they were not hard to be found, but eaſily procured: and therefore no wild Beaſts were required to be offered, becauſe God would not impoſe upon his People (as his words are) ſo great a Burden, as to bring him that which could not be got without ſome difficulty. For which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52830:6"/>cauſe alſo young Pigeons and Turtles were only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered among Birds. He gives other Reaſons for this, which ſeem to me very far fetcht, and therefore I ſhall not mention them. But this I may further add, That as they were the moſt ready at hand, and in common uſe among Men at their Tables, (which he ſhould have noted as the plaineſt Reaſon of all) ſo they had been in moſt ancient uſe among Religious People in their Sacrifices. See XV <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. And it is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were reſtrained peculiarly to theſe, that they might not follow the Cuſtoms of the Gentiles; as they would have done, had they not been abridged in their liberty. Now though we find in <hi>Homer</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of <hi>Hecatombs</hi> (which were a Sacrifice of an hundred Oxen) and of perfect Lambs and Goats, whereby <hi>Achilles</hi> hoped <hi>Apollo</hi> might be appeaſed, and moved to ceaſe the Plague he had ſent upon the Greeks; yet there was no more ancient Sacrifice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen, if we may believe themſelves, then that of <hi>Swine.</hi> Which made that Learned Roman <hi>Varro</hi> derive the word <gap reason="foreign">

Sometimes indeed the Heathen burnt only a part, and reſerved the reſt to feaſt upon, as he there obſerves: But among the Jews no Man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver partaked of theſe Offerings. For there being <hi>four</hi> ſorts of Sacrifices preſcribed by the Law (as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> obſerves in his Preface to this Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 2.) the <hi>whole Burnt-offerings,</hi> the <hi>Sin-offerings,</hi> the <hi>Treſpaſs-offerings,</hi> and the <hi>Peace-offerings.</hi> There was this difference made between them; that of the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, whether it was a publick, or a private <hi>whole Burnt-offering,</hi> no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy partaked, no not the Prieſts themſelves; but it was intirely conſumed, except the Skin. Of the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> ſome part was burnt; the reſt the Prieſts had, and were to eat it in the Court of the Tabernacle (though there was one ſort of <hi>Sin-offering</hi> which was wholly conſumed, as the Burnt-offerings were). The <hi>third</hi> ſort, which were <hi>Treſpaſs-offerings,</hi> were only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for private Perſons; ſome part of which, as in the former, were burnt upon the Altar, and the reſt eaten by the Prieſts. As for the laſt (the <hi>Peace-offering</hi>) ſome part of ſuch Sacrifices were burnt on the the Altar, the Prieſt had the Breaſt and the right Shoulder; and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he that brought the Sacrifice eat with his Friends. I ſhall add no more, but that theſe <hi>whole Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> ſeem to have been ſimple Acknowledgments of God the Creator of the World, and Teſtifications
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52830:7"/>that they owned him to be their LORD, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in Covenant with him, and implored his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon them.

This was a Rite belonging to <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> as well as to <hi>Burnt-offerings,</hi> III. 2. and to <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> alſo, IV. 4. The meaning of which in this ſort of Offerings, ſeems to have been that he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52830:8"/>who brought the Sacrifice renounced all his Intereſt in it, and transferred it wholly to God, unto whoſe Service he intirely devoted it. It being like to the old Ceremony among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who laid their hands upon their Servants, when they gave them their Liberty, and abdicated their own Right in them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Hunc hominem liberum eſſe volo,</hi> I will that this Man be free: which was called <hi>Manumiſſion.</hi> In other Offerings it had another meaning, as I ſhall obſerve in due place: and it was imitated by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> though not without the addition of impious Superſtitions. For they wreathed back the Head of the Beaſt upward, when they ſacrificed to the Gods above; and thruſt down its Head towards the Ground, when they ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to their Infernal Deities; as <hi>J. Brentius</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in his Preface to this Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it ſhall be accepted for him, to make an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him.]</hi> It ſhall be ſo acceptable, as to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to the favour of the Divine Majeſty. For ſo the Hebrew word <hi>Capher</hi> ſeems here to ſignifie, not properly to make an Atonement (which was the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of a <hi>Sin-offering</hi>) but to own him to be in a ſtate of Reconciliation with God; unto whom, he was ſuppoſed to give up himſelf wholly, as he did this Beaſt. The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed, who ſtick to the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſignification of the word, fancy that theſe <hi>Burnt-offerings</hi> expiated evil Thoughts and Deſires: but there is no ground for this in Scripture; and the moſt that can be made of it is, that God accepted his Prayers which he made in general, for the forgiveneſs of all his ſins, when he laid his Hand upon the Head of this Sacrifice. For it muſt be here obſerved, that Laying on of Hands was always accompanied with Prayer, as appears by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s laying them on the Head of <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> XLVIII <hi>Gen.</hi> 14, 16, 20. and the

But if a Man had committed any ſin, there are other Sacrifices peculiarly appointed by the Law for their Expiation; which he was bound to offer with confeſſion of ſin, and prayer to God for pardon.</p>

                  <hi>And he ſhall kill the Bullock.]</hi> That is, the Man himſelf who brought it, as <hi>Raſi</hi> interprets it; or one of the <hi>Levites,</hi> as others underſtand it: For they killed the Paſchal Lamb at that great Paſſover menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXX. 17. as <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves. But he ſhould have added the reaſon of it, which <hi>Raſi</hi> there gives; that a great many of the Congregation having not ſanctified themſelves, (as we read in that place) <hi>therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the Paſſover, for every one that was not clean, to ſanctifie them unto the LORD.</hi> Otherwiſe every Man might kill his own Paſſover, XII <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. as they might do all their other Sacrifices. For certain it is, this was none of the works of Prieſts, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſhows in a paſſage mentioned by Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> (in his Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> p. 27.) out of <hi>Biath Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mik-dath.</hi> Where he quotes this very place to prove, That <hi>the killing of the holy things might lawfully be done by a Stranger; yea, of the most holy things: whether they were the holy things of private Perſons, or of the whole Congregation.</hi> The common Objection to this is, That none might come into the Court where the Altar was, but the Prieſts. To which the Anſwer is plain, That upon this occaſion other Perſons might come ſo far within the Court, be cauſe it was indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that the Man who brought the Sacrifice ſhould lay his hand upon the Head of it; which was to be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52830:9"/>done at the Altar, when it was to be ſlain.</p>

They received it in a Baſon (XXIV <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.) as the manner alſo was among the Heathen; which our learned <hi>Sheringham</hi> obſerves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Codex Joma</hi> (p. 85.) out of <hi>Homer's Odyſſ. L.</hi> III. where <hi>Thraſymedes</hi> is repreſented as cutting the Ox a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder with a Cleaver; and <hi>Perſeus</hi> as receiving the Blood in a Baſon, which he calls <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>And ſprinkle the blood round about upon the Altar,</hi> &amp;c.] That this might be done readily, one Prieſt received the Blood; and another took it from him, and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it about the Altar; or, as the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtand it, on every ſide of the Altar; which they performed by two ſprinklings, at the oppoſite Corners of it. Which was a Rite alſo uſed in <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſs-offerings:</hi> but in <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> the Blood was poured out at the foot of the Altar: See VII. 2. Thus the Heathen alſo themſelves took care the Blood of their Sacrifices ſhould not run upon the ground, but be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as I ſaid, in Veſſels prepared for that purpoſe; and then poured upon their Altars, and ſo offered and conſecrated to their Gods. So <hi>Lucian</hi> in his Book of Sacrifices, repreſents the Prieſt, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>And he ſhall flay the Burnt-offering.]</hi> Next followed the taking off the Skin; which God ordered to be given to the Prieſts, VII. 8. Though the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52830:9"/>burnt Skin and all, in ſome places, as <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Lucian</hi> in the fore-named place, (<hi>Hieroz. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>p.</hi> 324.) But whoſe work it was to flay the Beaſt, is not here expreſſed. The Jews ſay it belonged not to the Prieſts to do this; but to the Man himſelf, who brought the Beaſt to be offered. For (to ſhow in brief what belonged to the <hi>owners of the Sacrifice, and what to the Prieſts</hi>) it may be fit to note out of <hi>Abarbanel,</hi> that each of them had <hi>five</hi> things to do. The Owner of the Sacrifice laid his hand upon it, killed, flayed, cut it up, and waſht the inwards: And then the Prieſt received the Blood in a Veſſel; ſprinkled the Blood; put fire on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; ordered the Wood on the fire; and ordered the pieces of the Sacrifice upon the Wood. And that the Beaſt might more eaſily be flayed, there were eight Stone Pillars (as the Jews tells us in <hi>Middoth, cap.</hi> 3.) and Beams laid over them: in each of which there were <hi>three</hi> Iron hooks fixed; That the greater Beaſts might hang upon the higheſt, the leſſer upon the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and the leaſt of all on the loweſt: and ſo be more commodiouſly ſtript of their Skins. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Excoriation both <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeak, as the afore-named <hi>Dilheirus</hi> hath obſerved in the ſame Book, <hi>p.</hi> 255.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And cut it into pieces.]</hi> This followed the Excoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the Gentiles alſo, as the ſame Author ſhows. And it was done with ſuch accuracy, that <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith they diſſected the Sacrifice <gap reason="foreign">

Which is meant by <hi>giving fire,</hi> as the Phraſe is in the Hebrew; that is, diſpoſing it ſo, that it might burn quick. Yet, if the fire was taken off from the Altar, as when they removed the Camp, IV <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. none might lay it on again but the Prieſt. Or, if it were extinct, as it was in the days of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who ſhut up the door of the Houſe of God, which was not opened till <hi>Hezekiah</hi> reigned, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXVIII. 24.

               <p>
                  <hi>And lay the wood in order upon the fire.]</hi> This the Prieſts did every Morning and every Night, that the fire might be preſerved from going out. And when the time of the Morning and Evening Sacrifice came, they brought new Wood, and laid it in ſuch order upon the fire, that it might the better conſume the parts of the Sacrifice, that were laid thereon.</p>

So it is to be underſtood here, and in III. 9. IV. 35.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52830:11"/>us) at the North-ſide of the Altar: where there were certain Rings fixed, to which the Head, or, as ſome ſay, the Feet of the Beaſt, was tied, in order to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing killed. But they were not perfect Rings, as <hi>L'Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereur</hi> obſerves, being rather half-ſegments of Rings, one part of which was faſtned to the Pavement, and by the other the Neck of the Beaſt was tied to it.

They were alſo very anciently ſacrificed, XV <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. and of a gentle nature, (as <hi>Procopius</hi> and others obſerve). And <hi>Pigeons</hi> being beſt when they are young, and <hi>Turtles</hi> when full grown, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they are appointed to bring them, when they were moſt eſteemed.

And <hi>R.

Some of which were conſtant and ſtated, and alſo of a determinate quantity; being an Appendix to the daily Burnt-ſacrifice, Morning and Evening, as we read XXIX <hi>Exod.</hi> 38, 39, &amp;c. But theſe here ſpoken of were voluntary, when any Man's Devotion inclined him to acknowledge God, and implore his Divine Bleſſing.

                  <hi>And if thou bring an oblation of a meat-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baken in the oven.]</hi> This is the firſt ſort of baked <hi>Mincha's</hi> for the preparing of which there was an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in the Court of the Tabernacle, as afterward there was in the Court of the Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXIII. 28, 29.

                  <hi>It ſhall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.]</hi> If the Cakes were thick, then the Oil was kneaded together with them: But if they were thin (like a <hi>Wafer</hi>) then it was only ſpread upon it, before it was baked, (See XXIX <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.) or, as ſome will have it, after it came out of the Oven.

                  <hi>And if thy oblation be a meat-offering baken in a pan.]</hi> Or in a <hi>flat Plate,</hi> as we tranſlate it in the Margin. For <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſays, this was the difference between <hi>Macabath</hi> (which is the Hebrew word in this place) and <hi>Marcheſheth,</hi> that the former was a <hi>Pan</hi> or <hi>Plate</hi> without any Rim about it; and the other had one, as our Frying-pans have. And ſo <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> in his Preface to this Book, obſerves out of <hi>Jarchi,</hi> that there was a Veſſel in the Temple, which was only flat and broad, but had no riſing on the ſides of it: So that the Oil being poured upon it, when it was ſet on the fire, ran down and increaſed the Flame, and made the Cake hard.</p>

Or, if this Diviſion was made after it was taken off, the reaſon was the ſame; becauſe part of it was to be given to God, and the reſt to the Prieſts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It ſhall be made of fine flour with oil.]</hi> The Oil was not kneaded with this ſort of <hi>Mincha,</hi> but put into the Pan, ſo that it mixed with the Flour; which might be ſhaken and moved up and down, as things are which are baken in Liquors. So <hi>Abarbinels</hi> words are in his Preface to this Book.</p>

                  <hi>No meat-offering which ye ſhall bring unto the LORD, ſhall be made with leaven.]</hi> Theſe words <hi>[which ye ſhall bring unto the LORD]</hi> ſeem to have a peculiar <hi>emphaſis</hi> in this place; importing that no Meat-offering, part of which was offered upon God's Altar, ſhould be leavened. For no part of that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened Bread which was offered in Euchariſtical Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, (VII. 13.) nor the two Loaves offered in the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> (which ſome miſtake for an Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Precept) were offered upon the Altar, but given intirely to the Prieſts, as their portion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Made with leaven.]</hi> There are many Moral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given, both by Jewiſh and Chriſtian Writers, why none of the Cakes before-mentioned ſhould have any Leaven in them, which I ſhall not here ſet down. There is ſome probability in their Opinion, who think this was ordered to refreſh their Memory, by putting them in mind of their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſeems to me to have given the beſt account of this, in his <hi>More Nevochim</hi> (<hi>P.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 46.) where he ſaith, God prohibited this to root out the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52830:17"/>Cuſtoms in thoſe days, as he found in the Books of the <hi>Zabij,</hi> who <hi>offered to their Gods no Bread but leavened.</hi> Next to this, the Account which <hi>Abarbanel</hi> gives of it is not to be diſregarded, who thinks it was forbidden, becauſe it would have made delay, if they had waited at the Tabernacle till the fermentation was perfected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For ye ſhall burn no leaven, nor any honey in any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the LORD made by fire.]</hi> Neither mixed with Bread, nor alone by themſelves. For <hi>Honey</hi> was a kind of Leaven, and it is certain was uſed by the Heathen in their Religious Rites: As appears not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Maimonides</hi> (who tells us in the place fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, that <hi>they choſe ſweet things for their offerings, and anointed their Sacrifices with Honey</hi>) but from a great number of other Authors, who make mention of it: Particularly <hi>Plato,</hi> who ſaith (in his VI <hi>de Legibus</hi>) that anciently Men did not Sacrifice living Creatures, but only fine Flour, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and Fruits moiſtned with Honey. And ſo <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchus</hi> tells us (in <hi>Athenaeus</hi> his <hi>Deipnoſ. L.</hi> XV.) that the Greeks ſacrificed Honey to the Sun (which was the great God among the Gentiles) but poured no Wine upon his Altars. Which <hi>Polemon</hi> (in <hi>Suidas</hi>) calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>ſober Sacrifice;</hi> becauſe there was no Wine in it, but Honey and Water mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nay, there was ſcarce any God among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, to whom Honey was not offered, as <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath ſhown at large in his <hi>Hierozoicon P.</hi> II. <hi>L.</hi> IV. <hi>c.</hi> 12. But one Teſtimony may ſerve for all, which is from <hi>Pauſanias</hi> (in his <hi>Eliaca</hi>) where having reckoned up at leaſt <hi>fifty</hi> Altars in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Olympius</hi> unto ſeveral Deities, and ſome of them common to them all, he ſaith, They ſacrificed upon every one of them once a Month, after an ancient manner, (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Frankincenſe and Wheat mingled with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi> Which being ſo common and ancient a thing among the Gentiles in their Idolatrous Worſhip, was the reaſon, it is likely, that God forbad it to be uſed in his Sacrifices.

               <p>
                  <hi>Neither ſhalt thou ſuffer the ſalt of the Covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat-offerings.]</hi> It is called the <hi>Salt of the Covenant of God,</hi> as ſome think, becauſe required by this Law, which they covenanted with God to obſerve, as much as to offer Sacrifices; which were not acceptable without Salt, as appears from the Repetition of it <hi>three</hi> times in this one Verſe. But
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52830:18"/>there is a plainer reaſon than this, which is, That the Sacrifices being God's Feaſts, and they that did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of them being his Gueſts, who did in a manner eat and drink with him at his Table; the Salt that was caſt upon all Sacrifices (as appears by the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing) is called <hi>the Salt of the Covenant,</hi> to ſignifie that, as Men were wont to make Covenants by eating and drinking together, (where Salt is never wanting at their Tables, but a neceſſary Appendix at every Feaſt) ſo God by theſe Sacrifices and the Feaſts upon them, did ratifie and confirm his Covenant with thoſe that did partake of them. For Salt, as is commonly obſerved, being a conſtant concomitant of all Feaſts, and Covenants being made by eating and drinking at the ſame Table, where Salt was ever uſed; thence <hi>Salt</hi> it ſelf was counted by the Ancients to be the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of Friendſhip,</hi> and proverbially uſed among the Greeks to expreſs it. By which other places may be explained, about which ſome have beſtowed vain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, (XVIII <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XIII. 5.) where the ſame words are uſed, but inverted; it being called <hi>a Covenant of Salt</hi> (inſtead of the <hi>Salt of the Covenant</hi>) becauſe Covenants, as I ſaid, were eſtabliſhed by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, where Salt is never wanting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With all thine Offerings thou ſhalt offer ſalt.]</hi> Not only with the <hi>Minchas,</hi> or Meat-offerings, mentioned in this Chapter, but with all other Sacrifices whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Which is ſo ſolemnly enjoyned, (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſays in the place before-named) becauſe the Heathen did not uſe any Salt in their Sacrifices. Which is not unreaſonable to think, ſince <hi>Honey</hi> (with which <hi>Salt</hi> doth not well agree) was in ſuch conſtant uſe among them. And therefore ſaith he, <hi>God prohibited us to offer Leaven or Honey, and commanded us with great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs, to uſe Salt in all our Sacrifices.</hi> That is, as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52830:18"/>
                  <hi>R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barcelona</hi> explains it, (<hi>Praecept.</hi> CXVI.) the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of all Sacrifices was to be ſalted; and the Meal of all <hi>Minchas.</hi> For which he gives theſe two Reaſons; becauſe nothing is grateful to the Palate without Salt; which alſo preſerves things from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as the Sacrifices did their Souls from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Abarbanel</hi> ſaith the ſame. And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Cuſtom might be in ancient time among the Heathen; in after Ages they learnt from <hi>Moſes</hi> to uſe it in all their Sacrifices: As appears from <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (and many other Authors) the firſt of which ſays, That <hi>Salt</hi> was ſo neceſſary, that no Sacrifices were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ſine mola Salſa:</hi> which every one knows the Greeks called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And among the Jews this <hi>Salt</hi> was not brought by him that offered the Sacrifice, but was provided at the Publick Charge; there being a Chamber in the Court of the Temple (as we read in <hi>Middoth, cap.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2.) called <hi>The Chamber of Salt.</hi> Which was one of the three Rooms on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Court (as there were three other on the South-ſide, for other uſes) where the Fleſh of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were powdered, as the <hi>Mincha's</hi> were ſeaſoned at the very Altar. And this was ſo neceſſary, that though a Sacrifice was not lookt upon as null, if the Prieſt neglected to ſalt it; yet the want of it in the <hi>Mincha's</hi> (as the Hebrew Doctors ſay) made them void; becauſe it is here ſo expreſly required in this Verſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer the Salt of the Covenant of thy God to be lacking in thy Meat-offering.</hi> And whoſoever offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any Sacrifice without Salt, or with Honey or Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, was beaten, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves, <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>de Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedr. cap.</hi> 13.</p>

                  <hi>And if thou offer a Meat-offering of thy first-fruits unto the LORD, thou ſhalt offer for thy Meat-offering,</hi> &amp;c.] This is very different from the Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52830:19"/>of Firſt-fruits mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 12. For there they are called <hi>Reſith,</hi> which ſignifies the Firſt-fruits at Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt time: but here <hi>Bichurim,</hi> which properly imports the <hi>firſt ripe fruits</hi> before the reſt were ready. And therefore the manner of their Oblation was different from the former, which follows in the Concluſion of this Verſe. And firſt he deſcribes what he means by the Firſt-fruits, which he calls <hi>Abib, i. e.</hi> full Ears of Corn, but as yet <hi>green and moiſt:</hi> which he ſaith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the next place muſt be <hi>dried by the fire;</hi> and then bruiſed and beaten in a Mortar, or with a Mill: and they were to be brought out of the richeſt or fatteſt of their Fields: for ſo the laſt words ſeem to ſignifie <hi>Gereſh Carmel,</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>Corn beaten out of full Ears</hi>) for <hi>Carmel</hi> ſometimes ſignifies a <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Field,</hi> XXXII <hi>Iſa.</hi> 15. and therefore may very well be thought in this place to import, <hi>the largeſt Ears of tender Corn.</hi> And the intention of its Contuſion ſeems to have been, that it might be reduced into Flour; as it might eaſily be after it had been <hi>dried by the fire.</hi> And therefore differed from that Meat-offering menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>v.</hi> 1. only in this; that the former was Flour of old Corn, this of new: and that was fine Flour ſifted from the Bran; this had nothing taken out of it, but remained as it came from the Mortar or the Mill. And ſo the LXX. ſeem to have underſtood it. There are thoſe indeed, who think it was only thraſhed out of the Husk, and ſo offered; and fancy alſo that from this word <hi>Gereſh,</hi> the Goddeſs, called <hi>Ceres,</hi> had her Name among the Gentiles. Which laſt Conceit is the ſtranger, ſince they endeavour to have it thought, that the <hi>Jews</hi> derived this Cuſtom of offering Firſt-fruits from the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and not the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from the <hi>Jews.</hi> Whereas the Gentiles had no ſuch Cuſtom, that I can find, as this, to offer the Firſt-fruits of <hi>Green Corn;</hi> but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52830:19"/>only the Firſt-fruits of their Harveſt, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Novas fruges:</hi> of which the <hi>Romans</hi> thought it unlawful to taſte, <hi>antequam Sacerdotes primitias libaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> before the Prieſts had offered the Firſt-fruits, as <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, <hi>Lib.</hi> XVIII. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. and <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> ſaith the ſame, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>de Die Natali.</hi> Or if they did offer any Firſt-fruits before Corn was ripe, they boiled them in a Pot; but did not roſt them in the fire, as is here directed.

                  <hi>AND if his oblation be a ſacrifice of peace-offering.]</hi> Having given orders about <hi>whole Burnt-offerings,</hi> in the firſt Chapter, and <hi>Meat-offerings</hi> (which had ſomething of that Nature in them) in the ſecond; he proceeds to <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> which in the Hebrew are called <hi>Schelamim,</hi> from the word <hi>Schalam,</hi> either as it ſignifies <hi>Retribution,</hi> or <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord.</hi> They that take it in the <hi>firſt</hi> ſence, think the reaſon of the name to be from this; That God, the Offerer, and the Prieſt, had each of them their portion aſſigned to them of this Sacrifice. And they that follow the <hi>ſecond</hi> ſence do not much differ, when they ſay, That theſe Sacrifices were Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols of Friendſhip between God, and the Prieſts, and thoſe that brought them; for all theſe feaſted at a Common Table, as <hi>R. Levi ben Gerſom</hi> expreſſes it. For part being offered on the Altar, and the Prieſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken his ſhare, the reſt was given to him that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Sacrifice. So that it was called a <hi>Peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abarbanel</hi> (in his Preface to this Book) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it made Peace</hi> (or rather declared Peace) <hi>between the Altar, the Priest, and the Owner.</hi> But they ſeem to me to have given the beſt account of this, who, becauſe <hi>Peace</hi> in their Language ſignifies <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> think theſe were called <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were principally thankful Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Mercies received from God's Bounty.

It might not be done by a Deputy, unleſs he was Heir to one that had vowed this Sacrifice, and died before he had performed it; in which caſe the Heir was to do what the Man himſelf ſhould have done, if he had been alive, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> obſerves. In this Sacrifice, <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> ſeems to have been done, not only
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52830:21"/>with Prayer to God, that he would accept the Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which the Jews ſay always accompanied this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) but with acknowledgment of thoſe Mercies which were the occaſion of it.

                  <hi>Male or Female.]</hi> See <hi>v.</hi> 1.

To which may be added, that Birds were allowed for <hi>whole Burnt-offerings</hi> (I. 14, 15, &amp;c.) but not for <hi>Peace-offerings:</hi> which were only of the <hi>Herd,</hi> or <hi>Flock; i. e.</hi> of Bullocks, Sheep, or Goats. The reaſon ſeems to be plain; becauſe <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> being to be divided between God, the Prieſt, and him that brought them, the portion of each would have been ſo ſmall, that it would have made the Feaſt upon it ſo very meagre and jejune, that it would have been contemptible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall offer it without blemiſh.]</hi> It was at his choice whether he would bring it from the <hi>Herd</hi> or the <hi>Flock:</hi> but in its kind it was to be perfect. See <hi>chap.</hi> I. 3, 9.</p>

For the <hi>whole Rump</hi> of a Sheep was to be offered to God, though not of a Bullock, nor a Goat.

                  <hi>AND the LORD ſpake unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.]</hi> Having directed him about <hi>whole Burnt-offerings,</hi> and <hi>Meat-offerings</hi> (which conſtantly attended ſome of them) and <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> which ſuppoſed Men to be in a ſtate of favour with God; he now proceeds to give order about the Expiation of their Sins, when they had offended him, by doing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Commands; which he continues to the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                  <hi>Chapter.</hi> And this Law about <hi>Sin-offerings,</hi> ſeems to have been delivered to <hi>Moſes</hi> at a different time from the former; being about a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent matter; but by a Voice ſpeaking to him out of the Tabernacle, as before, <hi>ch.</hi> I. 1.</p>

                  <hi>Speak unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaying, If a ſoul ſhall ſin through ignorance,</hi> &amp;c.] There are three Conditions expreſſed in this Verſe, of the Sin for which the following Sacrifice was admitted. <hi>First,</hi> It was to be committed <hi>ignorantly;</hi> not wittingly and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was for Sin againſt a <hi>negative</hi> Precept (as the Jews call them) <hi>i.e.</hi> ſuch a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as forbad ſomething to be done. So it is ſaid here expreſly [<hi>Concerning things which ought not to be done].</hi> As for the omiſſion of ſuch things as were commanded to be done, they might be performed ſome other time when Men had better bethought themſelves; which was much more acceptable to God, than offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice for the omiſſion. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> It was for <hi>Facts</hi> committed, not for <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Thoughts;</hi> ſo the laſt words are, <hi>and ſhall do againſt any of them.</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52830:24"/>As for the ſins which Men might imprudently commit in <hi>word</hi> and in <hi>thought,</hi> they were ſo many, that the whole Flocks and Herds would not have ſufficed for their Expiation, nor the Altar contained all ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. The Jews add a <hi>fourth</hi> Condition, That the Sacrifice here appointed was for ſuch <hi>Facts,</hi> as if they had been committed wittingly, a <hi>Cereth,</hi> i. e. <hi>cutting off,</hi> was threatned to them by the Law: which they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from XV <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. But that phraſe <hi>with an high hand</hi> ſeems not to ſignifie any <hi>ſort</hi> of ſin, but a certain <hi>manner</hi> of ſinning: as when a Man deſpiſed God's Commandments, and brought Contempt upon the Law by his ſins, as a very learned Friend of mine, now with God, hath obſerved. And therefore it is probable all ſins committed ignorantly were expiated by the following Sacrifices, ſave only thoſe which are appointed to be expiated by other Sacrifices, or after another manner. See Dr. <hi>Owtram de Sacrificiis, L.</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>n.</hi> 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>If the Priest that is anointed do ſin.]</hi> And firſt he preſcribes the Sacrifice, which he who was to make the great Expiation for all the People, ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> the High-Prieſt: who only, of all the Prieſts, was conſtantly anointed at the entrance of his Office. And if after he was put out of his Office, he committed any ſuch ſin as is here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was to make this Offering for his Expiation, as much as if he had continued in it. So Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves out of the <hi>Miſna, L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. cap.</hi> 15. <hi>n.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According to the ſin of the people.]</hi> In the manner before-mentioned. Or, as <hi>R. Solomon</hi> interprets it, if he hide any thing from the People, whereby they err. For ſo the words run in the Hebrew, if he ſin <hi>to the guilt of the people,</hi> (or, to the making them guilty) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52830:25"/>by miſinforming them, or drawing them into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by his Example; ſo that they take a thing to be clean, which is indeed unclean, or the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then let him bring for his ſin which he hath ſinned, a young bullock without blemiſh.]</hi> It is obſerved by ſome, that in great Offences the Sacrifices were ſmall; leſt they ſhould imagine their Pardon was procured by their great expence. For here the word is <hi>Par ben ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chur, a young Bullock,</hi> that was but a little bigger than a Calf. And ſo this Sacrifice is called <hi>(Par)</hi> in the following Verſes. Whereas that of the <hi>Peace-offering</hi> is called <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Shor,</hi> an <hi>Ox,</hi> (though we tranſlate it alſo, <hi>Bullock</hi>) one that was grown to its full bigneſs, and conſequently of greater value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For a ſin-offering.]</hi> How <hi>Chattah,</hi> which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate Sin-offering, differs from <hi>aſcham,</hi> which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate Treſpaſs-offering, I ſhall examine afterward, when <hi>Moſes</hi> comes to ſpeak of the latter. And now only obſerve, that <hi>Chattah</hi> is the name both for <hi>Sin,</hi> and for the <hi>Sin-offering;</hi> as the word <hi>piaculum</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen; which ſignified both a great Crime, and the Expiatory Sacrifice for it. By which thoſe words in the New Teſtament may be explained, <hi>Christ was made ſin for us;</hi> that is, a Sacrifice to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate our ſins. And ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſin,</hi> certainly ſignifies, VIII <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</p>

                  <hi>And he ſhall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.]</hi> This, as I take it, was to be done by himſelf; who was to preſent the Sacrifice to the Divine Majeſty, and deſire it might be accepted for the purpoſe to which it was to be offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhall lay his hand upon the bullocks head.]</hi> As every one that brought other Offerings were bound to do, (See <hi>ch.</hi> I. 4. III. 2, &amp;c.) but here for another
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52830:25"/>purpoſe; <hi>viz.</hi> to confeſs their ſins unto the LORD, and beſeech him to forgive them. See V. 5. There is a good Gloſs upon this, in a very bad Book called <hi>Nitzachon,</hi> not long ago publiſhed by the Learned <hi>Wagenſeil:</hi> where that Author ſaith, (<hi>p.</hi> 11.) <hi>When a Man ſacrificed a Beast he was to think in his mind, I am more a Beast than this here preſent. For I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and for the ſins I have committed, I offer this: but it were more just that he who hath ſinned ſhould ſuffer death, than this Beast</hi> (which hath not offended) <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus a Man, by the help of this Sacrifice, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And kill the bullock before the LORD.]</hi> This ſeems to have been done by him that laid his hand on the head of the Bullock, that is, by the High-Prieſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For the greateſt Men, in old time, did not think ſuch work below them; but rather eſteemed every thing that ſerved to the Worſhip of God, to be noble and honourable. So <hi>Homer</hi> repreſents King <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> as killing the Lambs himſelf; by the Blood of which he was to Seal the Treaty he made with the <hi>Trojans, Iliad.</hi> 3. yet in this caſe it is likely the High-Prieſt himſelf did not kill the Sacrifice, but ſome of the other Prieſts that then miniſtred. For he that did this, ſeems to be diſtinguiſhed, by the next words (<hi>v.</hi> 5.) from the <hi>Priest that is anointed;</hi> i. e. the High-Prieſt. Nor was this Sacrifice killed in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary place where <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> were killed, (See 24.) being an extraordinary ſort of Offering, as that which follows alſo was.</p>

                  <hi>And the Priest that is anointed.]</hi> Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever killed the Sacrifice, the High-Prieſt himſelf, for whom it was offered, did what follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shall take of the bullocks blood.]</hi> In a Baſin.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And bring it to the Tabernacle of the Congregation.]</hi> Into the very Sanctuary; where, as it follows, he was to dip his finger in the Blood, and ſprinkle it ſeven times before the LORD.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>6</label>
                  <hi>And the Priest ſhall dip his finger in the blood.]</hi> Or rather, <hi>dip it into the blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſprinkle of the blood ſeven times before the LORD.]</hi> This was peculiar to his Sacrifice for Sin, and done in no other but that for the whole Congregation. To ſignifie perhaps, that their Offences were more heinous, and could not be ſo eaſily expiated, as thoſe of other Men. The number <hi>ſeven,</hi> every one knows, was of great account, and thought moſt powerful in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions, even among the Heathen. For as <hi>Eliſha</hi> bad <hi>Naaman</hi> go and waſh <hi>ſeven times in Jordan,</hi> to cure him of his Leproſy; ſo <hi>Apuleius</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the XI<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of his <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> ſpeaks of dipping the head <hi>ſeven times</hi> in the Sea for Purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gives the reaſon for it; <hi>Quod eum numerum praecipuè religioni aptiſſimum divinus ille Pythagoras pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didit;</hi> becauſe the Divine <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (as he calls him) <hi>taught this number to be above all other most proper in Religion.</hi> Which in all probability, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> learnt from the truly Divine <hi>Moſes:</hi> to whom God revealed the Creation of the World in <hi>ſix</hi> days, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day, on which he reſted; which made the number <hi>ſeven</hi> ſo much uſed in Sacred Matters. For not only in this Sacrifice, but in making the Water of Separation by burning a red Heifer, this Rite was uſed, (XIX <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.) and in purging a Leper, (XIV <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.) in dedicating the Altar (XXIX <hi>Exod.</hi> 37.) when the Oil was ſprinkled on it ſeven times, (VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.) and at the Conſecration of the Prieſts, (XXIX <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.) and, to ſay no more, as every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the Week was holy, ſo every ſeventh
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52830:26"/>year the Land reſted; and after Seven times ſeven there was a <hi>Jubilee,</hi> XXV <hi>Levit.</hi> They that would ſee more of this number, and of its <hi>Sacramenta,</hi> as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks, may read him upon V <hi>Amos</hi> 3. and <hi>Druſius</hi> on this place, and on VI <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4.

XVI <hi>Lev.</hi> 2, &amp;c.) as the other Vail, which was before the Door of the Tabernacle, is conſtantly called <hi>Maſach,</hi> XXVI <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 36, 37.</p>

                  <hi>And the Prieſt ſhall put ſome of the Blood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the horns of the Altar of ſweet incenſe,</hi> &amp;c.] This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was peculiar to his Sacrifice; and to that for the whole Congregation, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhall pour out all the blood of the bullock.]</hi> That is, all the reſt of the Blood which remained after the ſprinkling before the Mercy-ſeat; and the tipping of the Horns of the Altar with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At the bottom of the Altar of the burnt-offering.]</hi> Where, after the building of the Temple, there were two holes; one on the Weſt-ſide of the Altar, the other on the South, (as the Jews tell us in <hi>Middoth, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2.) by which it was conveyed into a <hi>Canal</hi> under Ground, through which it ran into the Brook <hi>Kidron.</hi> And there was only this difference (they ſay) about theſe two holes, that the Blood of the Sin-offering (any part of which was carried into the moſt holy place) was poured out only into that on the Weſt-ſide of the Foundation of the Altar. And, if we may believe the Jews, the Gardiners bought this Blood of thoſe that were the Treaſurers of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to inrich their Ground with it, as <hi>Conſtantine
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52830:27"/>l'Empereur</hi> there obſerves. And while they were in the Wilderneſs, and all the time they had only a move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Tabernacle, it is moſt likely there were Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles made under Ground, with Conveyances to ſome diſtant place, where it ſank into the Earth, or was covered with Duſt, as other Blood is commanded to be, XVII. 13. For <hi>Maimonides</hi> thinks the pouring out the Blood (ſo that it might not remain in one place) which is conſtantly and ſtrictly required by the Law, was in oppoſition to an idolatrous Cuſtom of the old <hi>Zabij;</hi> who made a collection of the Blood in a Veſſel, or in a little Pit, about which they ſat, and ate the Fleſh, imagining their Gods feaſted upon the Blood; as I noted before out of <hi>Maimonides, More Nevoch.

                  <hi>And he ſhall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the ſin-offering,</hi> &amp;c.] All that follows in this and the <hi>two</hi> next Verſes, (<hi>v.</hi> 9, 10.) is the ſame that was ordered to be done about <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 10.

                  <hi>And the skin of the bullock, and all his fleſh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards,</hi> &amp;c.] This Sacrifice was ſo laborious, to work in them a greater deteſtation of ſin; which was aggravated by the quality of the Perſon that committed it. And <hi>Nachmanides</hi> hath an obſervation which (in ſome parts of it, at leaſt) is very remarkable;
<q>That all a Man doth, being performed in Words, in Works, or Thoughts, God commanded them when they brought an Offering for Sin, that they ſhould <hi>lay their hand</hi> on it, which had reſpect to the Works they had
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52830:27"/>done; and <hi>make Confeſſion</hi> over it, which had reſpect to their Words; and burn the <hi>Inwards</hi> and <hi>Kidneys,</hi> which are the Organs of Thoughts and Deſires; the <hi>Legs</hi> alſo, had a reſpect to a Man's hands and feet, by which he doth all his work; and the <hi>Blood</hi> that was ſprinkled on the Altar ſignified his own Blood. <hi>So that while a Man did all theſe things, he was put in mind how he had ſinned against God, both in Soul and Body, and deſerved to have his Blood ſhed and his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy burnt; unleſs the Mercy of the Creator had accepted a Price of Redemption for him,</hi> viz. <hi>a Sacrifice; whoſe Blood was for his Blood, and its Life for his Life; and the principal Members of the Sacrifice, for the Members of his Body.</hi>
                  </q> By which it appears that the beſt ſort of Jews had a ſenſe, that the Sacrifices for Sin were offered to God in their ſtead, as a Ranſom for them. And ſo we Chriſtians are to underſtand the Sacrifice which Chriſt made of himſelf, who <hi>gave himſelf a Ranſom for us all,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks I <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. and our LORD ſaith the ſame XX <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. X <hi>Mark</hi> 45. Such Sacrifices the Heathens themſelves had, which they called <hi>Luſtralia,</hi> from the word <hi>luſtrare,</hi> which ſignifies to <hi>expiate</hi> among the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that by <hi>paying a price.</hi> For the ancient Poet <hi>Ennius</hi> (as our excellent Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> hath obſerved) tranſlating into Latin a Greek Tragedy called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Even the whole bullock ſhall he carry forth without the Camp.]</hi> It was not diſſected, as the <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> were, becauſe no Body was to partake of any
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52830:28"/>part of it; being a Sacrifice for the Prieſts own ſin. And therefore it was to be carried (though not by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but ſome other Perſon) to be burnt without the Camp, to expreſs the abominableſs of the Sin. This Rite, and the carrying the Blood within the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to be ſprinkled before the LORD, were uſed only in theſe two Caſes; of the Sin of the High-Prieſt, and of all the People. For of other Sin-offerings the Prieſts might eat, (VI. 26.) but of this, being for himſelf, he was not to taſte at all, becauſe he was in a ſtate of Guilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Into a clean place, where the aſhes are poured out.]</hi> On the Eaſt-part of the Tabernacle there was a place for the Aſhes to be thrown into, when they were taken from the Altar; which afterward were carried into a clean place, without the Camp. And ſo they were carried out, after the Temple was built at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at the Eaſt-gate of the City, into a Valley which lay between <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and Mount <hi>Olivet.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And burn him on the wood with fire.]</hi> Not upon an Altar, but in a fire made with Wood upon the Ground, to ſhow the odiouſneſs of the ſin, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> thinks. For as the whole <hi>Burnt-ſacrifices</hi> were burnt on the Altar, becauſe they were an <hi>Offering of ſweet ſmelling ſavour</hi> unto God; ſo this was burnt without the Camp upon the Ground, to ſhow that the <hi>odour of it was ungrateful and abominable;</hi> More Nevochim, P. III. cap. 46. where he alſo obſerves, that the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Beaſt intirely, being the deſtruction of it, ſo that nothing of it remained, it ſignified in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the utter deletion of Sin, ſo that it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred no more. And the Bullock being burnt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Camp, I take it to denote, that the People ſhould not ſuffer for the ſin of the Prieſt, which was aboliſhed together with his Sacrifice.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52830:28"/>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Maimonides</hi> hath another obſervation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Title <hi>Zebachim,</hi> that there were <hi>three</hi> places conſtituted for the burning of holy things. The <hi>firſt</hi> was in the Sanctuary, as every one knows; the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> was in the Mount of the Houſe, (as they called the place round about the Court of the Sanctuary) where if any blemiſh hapned to a Bullock or a Goat, they were brought out of the Sanctuary, and burnt in a place called <hi>Bira:</hi> and the <hi>third</hi> was in this place of the Aſhes, without the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where the aſhes are poured out, there ſhall he be burnt.]</hi> This is repeated, that none might preſume to take the liberty to burn the Bullock in any other place.</p>

With this diſtinction between Capital and Pecuniary Cauſes, that in the latter a Man was not bound to come and teſtifie, unleſs he was cited by the Plaintiff, or by the Court; but in Capital Cauſes, and in ſuch things as the Law prohibited, (as if a Man ſaw another ſmite his Neighbour) he was bound to come of his own accord, without any Summons, and give his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in Court. Yet in this they make ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as may be ſeen in <hi>R. Levi Barcelonita, Praecept.</hi> CXX.

               <p>
                  <hi>For a treſpaſs-offering.]</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Aſcham,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Treſpaſs-offering,</hi> is ſo near of kin to <hi>Chattah,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> that one of them is ſometimes uſed for the other, as I obſerved upon <hi>v.</hi> 6. yet there is a real difference between them; though it be not eaſie to determine wherein it conſiſts. For the greateſt Men differ in their opinion, about the quality of the Offences, for which theſe two kinds of Sacrifices were to be offered: Some ſaying that the Offences for which <hi>Aſcham</hi> was offered, were inferior to thoſe for which <hi>Chattah</hi> was offered; which is the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Maimonides</hi> in his <hi>More Nevochim, P.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 46. Others, on the contrary, think that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which were expiated by <hi>Aſcham,</hi> were more grievous than thoſe expiated by <hi>Chattah;</hi> which is the Opinion of no leſs Man than the deſervedly admired <hi>Bochartus,</hi> in his <hi>Hierozoicon, P.</hi> I. <hi>Lib.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. Where he adds, that the former ſort of ſins were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>knowingly;</hi> the other only <hi>ignorantly.</hi> For ſo the LXX. tranſlate <hi>Chattah</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſeems to denote a Fault committed by Error and Miſtake: but <hi>Aſcham</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which carries in it the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſomething premeditated and deſigned. But this is directly contrary to the very words of <hi>Moſes</hi> here in this Verſe; which expreſly ſpeak of a <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> committed through ignorance. <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> therefore diſtinguiſhes theſe two much better, making <hi>Chattah</hi> to ſignifice a Sacrifice which was made for the purging Offences, committed through <hi>ignorance</hi> of the Law: and <hi>Aſcham,</hi> for ſuch as were committed through <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs</hi> of the Law. But as he gives no proof of this, ſo he was ſenſible, it was liable to exception; there being one of this ſort of Sacrifices, mentioned
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52830:38"/>
                  <hi>v.</hi> 17. which he ſaw could not be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Rule. Others therefore think the former hath reſpect to Offences againſt God; and the latter to thoſe againſt Men; not obſerving that the very ſame ſort of ſin, which when it was known is called <hi>Chattah,</hi> when it was doubtful, is called <hi>Aſcham.</hi> From whence a very learned Perſon of our own, (now with God) who had much and long conſidered this matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, That an Offence was peculiarly called <hi>Aſcham,</hi> (which is a name for the Sin as well as for the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as <hi>Chattah</hi> alſo is) about which either a Man was dubious (as in the following Verſe) or did a manifeſt damage to other Men. There being no <hi>Aſcham</hi> (or <hi>Treſpaſs-offering</hi>) commanded to be offered by the Law, but for ſuch Offences as were ſo committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, that their Neighbours alſo were injured by them. As in the Caſe of thoſe who did eat holy things, here mentioned, whereby the Prieſts were damaged: and of thoſe mentioned VI. 2, 3, 4. and ſuch as lay with a Bond-woman betrothed to another, XIX. 20, 21. Which are all the Caſes belonging to this matter; excepting that of the <hi>Nazarite</hi> defiled by the dead, VI <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. and of the <hi>Leper,</hi> XIV. 12. who were to be purged with a <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> as well as with a <hi>Treſpaſs-offering:</hi> and therefore not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in this matter. See Dr. <hi>Owtram, L.</hi> I. <hi>de Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiis, cap.</hi> 13. <hi>n.</hi> 8. and <hi>Samuel Petitus</hi> his <hi>Variae Lecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones, cap.</hi> 22. who hath ſaid the ſame, but not ſo fully and diſtinctly. If this do not ſatisfie, yet it is plain the Sacrifices which go by this Name of <hi>Treſpaſs-offerings,</hi> and the Rites alſo about them, were ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that they are ſufficient to diſtinguiſh them from the other. For none but <hi>Rams</hi> and <hi>Male-Lambs</hi> were admitted for <hi>Treſpaſs-offerings;</hi> which were not uſed at all, in any <hi>Sin-offerings.</hi> And the Blood of the

                  <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> was put upon the Horns of the Altar (as was noted in the foregoing Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 18, 25.) but that of the <hi>Treſpaſs-offerings</hi> was ſprinkled round about upon the Altar, VII. 2. <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> alſo were offered for the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> IV. 13. but <hi>Treſpaſs-offerings</hi> only for private Perſons, which made <hi>Bonſrerius</hi> (I ſuppoſe) after a long diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this matter, to conclude, That the difference betwen <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſs,</hi> conſiſted only in the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were offered for them.

               <p>I cannot think fit to conclude this Chapter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking notice how <hi>Jonathan</hi> paraphraſes theſe laſt words of it; who inſtead of ſaying, he hath treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (as it is commonly tranſlated) <hi>againſt the LORD,</hi> ſaith <hi>againſt the Name of the Word of the LORD.</hi> Which is an obſervation that might have been made in my Notes upon the two foregoing Books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> where many ſuch paſſages occur, which I did not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I ſhould not have done it now (being unwilling to ſwell this Commentary with any thing that doth not tend to the explaining the ſenſe of the Text) did not the impious Pamphlets that have lately been ſpread abroad, againſt the Doctrine of the ever Bleſſed Trinity, made it neceſſary for me to take this occaſion to aſſert, That this Doctrine was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the ancient Jews; as appears even from the frequent mention of the <hi>Word of the LORD</hi> in the Chaldee Paraphraſts, where the Hebrew hath only <hi>JEHOVAH</hi> (or the <hi>LORD):</hi> For which I can ſee no reaſon at all, if there had not been a Notion among them, of more Perſons than One, who were <hi>JEHOVAH.</hi> It doth not always indeed carry this ſignification in it; but there are very many places where, by the <hi>WORD of the LORD,</hi> cannot be meant a <hi>word ſpoken by the LORD,</hi> or any thing elſe, but a <hi>perſon ſpeaking or acting,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who is the LORD.</hi> There is a famous inſtance of it in XXVIII <hi>Gen.</hi> 20, 21. where <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Vow is thus tranſlated by <hi>Onkelos: Jacob vowed a vow, ſaying, if the WORD of the LORD will be with me, and keep me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then ſhall the WORD of the LORD be my God.</hi> Where the <hi>WORD of the LORD</hi> is ſo plainly made the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

Levi Barzelonita</hi> expounds it, <hi>Praecept.</hi> CXXV. And the Jews pretend to ſuch ſcrupuloſity in this matter, that they ſay, a Man who was to have a ſhare in his Father's Eſtate, from whom he had taken ſomething by robbery, was to reſtore it before the Diviſion was made, and not by detaining it to make his ſhare great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than it ought to be.

The plain ſenſe is, that he ſhould compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate the loſs which the right Owner might have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (by wanting the uſe of his Goods ſo long as the other had detained them in his hand) by adding a full <hi>fifth</hi> part of the Principal, as an amends for the wrong. Yet if he had really forgotten that he had found ſuch a thing as he was charg'd withal, at the time he denied it upon Oath, he was not bound to pay the <hi>fifth</hi> part more, nor to offer the Expiatory Sacrifice, though he really was poſſeſſed of the thing; as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. cap.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 506.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52830:42"/>whom he had left to act for him. Yet they are ſomething humorſom in theſe Abſurdities, for they do not tye a Man to go ſo far to pay the <hi>fifth</hi> part; though in a caſe where it was more than a <hi>Peruta.</hi> See <hi>Bava kama, cap.</hi> 9. <hi>ſect.</hi> 5, 6.</p>

It is moſt likely that the carrying the Aſhes out of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, being not an holy action, as they were not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it in their Prieſtly, <hi>i. e.</hi> Sacred Garments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they took them from the Altar; ſo they did it in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52830:44"/>common Habit, which they wore when they did not miniſter. Yet <hi>Raſi</hi> thinks this was not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but only fitting and ſeemly: it being indecent to do this Work in the ſame Garments, wherein they ſerved at the Altar. And the Aſhes having been upon the Altar, there are thoſe (as I ſaid) who fancy this was not a Work fit to be performed in their common Garments; and therefore have deviſed an Habit of leſs dignity than thoſe Garments wherein they Miniſtred, which they uſed when they carried out the Aſhes. Thus <hi>Maimonides</hi> himſelf, and others, mentioned by Mr. <hi>Selden, L.</hi> III. <hi>de Synedr. cap.</hi> 11. <hi>n.</hi> 6. where he likewiſe obſerves that <hi>Chiskuni</hi> is of opinion, that ſuch of the Family of the Prieſts, as were both excluded from their Miniſtry in the Sanctuary, and from wearing the holy Garments, by reaſon of ſome defect in their Bodies, were permitted to perform this Office of carrying away the Aſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And carry forth the Aſhes without the Camp, into a clean place.]</hi> See IV. 12. The fore-mentioned <hi>Raſi</hi> will have it, that they needed not to take away all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes every day; but only a ſhovel full, which they laid beſide the Altar: And when the hollow place of the Altar was ſo full, that there was no room to lay on the Wood, they were bound to empty it, and carry all the Aſhes away.</p>

                  <hi>And the fire upon the Altar ſhall be burning in it, it ſhall not be put out.]</hi> This Precept is repeated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the next Verſe; as it was mentioned once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>v.</hi> 9. For which there is a juſt reaſon, as <hi>Abar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banel</hi> makes account. For in the <hi>ninth</hi> Verſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that the Wood for the Evening Sacrifice ſhould be ſo ordered and attended, that the fire might be kept in till the Morning. And then, here in this Verſe, he requires there ſhould ſuch care be uſed in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52830:44"/>taking away the Aſhes, that the fire might ſtill remain, and not be extinguiſhed. After which, ſpeaking of the Morning Sacrifice, in the latter part of this Verſe, he requires in the next (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) that ſuch a quantity of Wood ſhould be laid on the Altar, when they offered it, that the fire might be kept in till the Evening Sacrifice: or, that if there were any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Sacrifices brought beſides the daily Burnt-offering, the Prieſts ſhould ſtill add more Wood, that the fire might not be put out by that means, but be able to devour them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Priest ſhall burn wood on it every morning,</hi> &amp;c.] The Hebrew word for <hi>Wood</hi> being in the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Number, <hi>R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barcelona</hi> concludes there were more bundles than one brought in every day. And from this place (and I. 7.) he gathers there were <hi>three.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> of which he calls the <hi>great heap;</hi> with which the daily Sacrifice, and the reſt, for which there was occaſion, were offered: of which he thinks <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks in the <hi>ninth</hi> Verſe of this Chapter. The <hi>ſecond</hi> was leſſer, which was laid at the ſide of the other, that they might have Coals for the burning Incenſe: and this, he thinks, intended here. And the <hi>third</hi> was meerly to keep in the fire perpetually, of which, he thinks, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks in the next Verſe. The <hi>Miſna</hi> alſo tells us, that there being ſeven Gates to the great Court of the Sanctuary, three on the <hi>North,</hi> and as many on the <hi>South,</hi> and one at the <hi>East;</hi> the firſt on the <hi>South</hi>-ſide was called the <hi>Gate of burning:</hi> becauſe, at that Gate they brought in the Wood, which was to preſerve the fire perpetually on the Altar: See <hi>Codex Middoth, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4.</p>

                  <hi>And he ſhall burn thereon the fat of the peace-offerings.]</hi> This fat of the <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> was to be burnt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Burnt-offering,</hi> and not ſeparate from it:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52830:45"/>by which means the Burnt-offering was the ſooner conſumed, and more room was made for other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Sacrifices.</p>

                  <hi>And the fire ſhall be ever burning upon the Altar.]</hi> This fire was not kindled by the Prieſts, but by God himſelf; who ſent it from Heaven to conſume the firſt Sacrifice that was offered by <hi>Aaron,</hi> IX. <hi>ult.</hi> From which time they were bound to take care, that it never went out; that ſo their Sacrifices might be conſtantly offered by Celeſtial fire: becauſe it was the continuation of that fire which came from Heaven, by a continual addition of Fewel, whereby it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And ſo it continued, as the Jews affirm, till the Captivity of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and after it, as ſome of them would have us believe, (who fancy it was preſerved in a Pit, by the care of ſome religious Prieſts, till their return) though againſt the common Tradition among them, which is, That <hi>there was no ſacred fire in the ſecond Temple;</hi> for they reckon this among the <hi>five</hi> things which were wanting there, and had been in the firſt. And as for the conſtant continuance of this fire, there was care taken that wood ſhould be laid up in the Temple for the maintenance of it: ſo in order thereunto, there was a certain ſet time, when the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were obliged to carry wood thither; which made a kind of Feſtival, called by <hi>Joſephus</hi>

But his Garments being holy, the Blood that might chance to fall upon them, was not thereby at all diſhonoured: and therefore (if this be the meaning) we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the Garments would appear leſs venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when they were ſpotted with Blood; and upon that account were to be waſhed. If we take it for the Garment of him that brought the Sacrifice, which when
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52830:49"/>it was killed, the Blood might chance to ſpurt upon his Clothes; then the waſhing of them, was out of reverence to the Blood; which being holy, was not to remain upon a common Garment.

And being of a ſmall value, it was no great loſs to have it broken; rather than any thing that was holy, remaining in it, be profaned. What became of the broken ſhreds of theſe earthen Veſſels, is a doubt among the Hebrew Doctors; becauſe it was neither fit to throw them out into a prophane place, nor yet ſeemly to heap them up in the Sanctuary: and therefore they fancy the Earth opened and ſwallowed them up, as a great Man in this kind of Learning (<hi>J. Wagenſeil</hi>) hath obſerved upon the <hi>Miſchna</hi> of <hi>Sota, cap.</hi> 3. But they might have rather ſaid, that they were thrown abroad into a clean place, after they were broken into ſmall bits, or crumbled to powder; juſt as the Aſhes were that came from the Altar, which was an holy place.</p>

From this Verſe, compared with other places, it ſeems apparent that nothing was roaſted in the Sanctuary, but only boiled.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52830:53"/>theſe here mentioned, were all offered with Bread; and that offered with this, which was the firſt of them, was called <hi>the Bread of Thanksgiving. R.

For, as <hi>Philo</hi> obſerves (in his Book of <hi>Sacrifices) It was not ſit that theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things ſhould be put into their Cupboards, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſet before thoſe who were in need; for they were no longer his that offered them, but his to whom they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: who being himſelf most liberal and bountiful, would have Gueſts invited to his Table to partake with thoſe that offered the Sacrifice.

That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God himſelf, whoſe bounty ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, by preferring ſordid Parſimony before generous Humanity.</hi> His meaning is, that all the Sacrifice was God's, who graciouſly granted to him that offered it, a part of it, to entertain his Friends, and the Poor; whom he would have invited forthwith, that no part
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52830:54"/>of it might be converted to any other uſe, but that which God appointed, who made the Feaſt.</p>

                  <hi>But if the ſacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering.]</hi> Theſe two other ſorts of <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> were in the nature of Prayers, for the obtaining ſuch Bleſſings, as they deſired and hoped for.

               <p>
                  <hi>It ſhall be eaten the ſame day that he offereth his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.]</hi> Then they were immediately to begin to feaſt upon the Sacrifice.</p>

                  <hi>And on the morrow alſo the remainder of it ſhall be eaten.]</hi> But if they could not conveniently eat it all the ſame day, or had a mind to lay up ſome of it till the next, they had that liberty allowed them. For which <hi>Philo</hi> gives this reaſon (in the ſame Book) that theſe being for Mercies not yet received (or offered by vertue of an obligation) they might take more time to feaſt upon them with their Friends, and be more ſparing: but the former being a thankful Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Bleſſings already beſtowed, their hearts were to be inlarged in greater bounty. <gap reason="foreign">

Where they might eat them if they pleaſed (as I ſhowed before, VI. 16.) but were not determined to that place; but left at liberty to eat them in any part of the City where the Tabernacle, and afterward the Temple, ſtood.

Which was to preſerve the <hi>dignity of the Sacrifice,</hi> as the Jews ſpeak, in preventing its ſtinking.

The Heathens themſelves thought this a decent Rite;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52830:55"/>for there was a Sacrifice at <hi>Rome</hi> which they called <hi>Protervia,</hi> (as <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Macrobius, L.</hi> II. <hi>Saturnal. cap.</hi> 2.) in which the Cuſtom was, <hi>ut ſi quid ex epulis ſuperfuiſſet, igne conſumeretur,</hi> that if any thing of the Feaſt remained, it was conſumed in the fire.

                  <hi>And he ſprinkled thereof upon the Altar ſeven times; and anointed the Altar, and all its veſſels,</hi> &amp;c.] We do not find this expreſly before directed: but the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of anointing the Altar being to make it <hi>most holy</hi> (becauſe it was to ſanctifie all that was laid upon it, XXX <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. XL. 10.) it was very fit it ſhould be both ſprinkled <hi>ſeven</hi> times with Oil, and alſo anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: in token of its extraordinary Sanctity, which was put upon it by this very ſolemn Rite. For here are two diſtinct words about this anointing; the firſt is <hi>jaz,</hi> he <hi>ſprinkled</hi> of the Oil upon it; and then <hi>jimſhach,</hi> he anointed it, by putting ſome of the Oil on it:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52830:61"/>whereas it is ſaid of the Tabernacle, and of the things there, only <hi>jimſhach,</hi> he anointed them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſprinkling.</p>
               <p>Some think that the <hi>Altar</hi> being mentioned twice in this Verſe, he ſpeaks of the <hi>Altar of Incenſe,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Altar of Burnt-offerings.</hi> But it is plain by thoſe places in <hi>Exodus,</hi> it was the Altar of Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which was thus ſanctified: and here the Laver and its foot (which ſtood in the ſame Court) is ſaid to be ſanctified with it. As for the Altar of Incenſe, it is included in what is ſaid, in the foregoing Verſe, that he anointed <hi>the Tabernacle and all therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Both the laver and his foot, to ſanctifie them.]</hi> It may be thought that he <hi>ſprinkled</hi> with Oil the <hi>Laver</hi> and its <hi>Foot,</hi> as well as <hi>anointed</hi> them; which is the opinion of the fore-named <hi>Fort. Scacchus.</hi> But the Hebrew words will not warrant it; for they only ſignifie that they were <hi>anointed</hi> as the Altar was after its aſperſion.</p>

                  <hi>And he poured of the anointing oil upon</hi> Aarons <hi>head.]</hi> Here now is a third word diſtinct from the two former, <hi>viz. jitzok;</hi> which ſignifies there was more done to <hi>Aaron,</hi> than to any of the holy things, to ſanctifie him to his office: For the holy Oil was poured on his Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And anointed him.]</hi> Perhaps he drew the Oil with his finger upon his Forehead, after it was poured on his Head; as the Jews think he did. See XXIX <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 7, 8. XXX. 30. XL. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſanctifie him.] i. e.</hi> Set him apart to this Sacred Office. Now this Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, being mentioned here together with the Conſecration of the Tabernacle and all belonging to it; it hath made ſome conclude, that both were done at the very ſame time. But I have given ſome Arguments to prove the contrary, upon XL <hi>Exod.</hi> 17, 18. And the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52830:62"/>of theſe <hi>three</hi> Verſes (10th, 11th, 12th of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) may be, not that they were Conſecrated at the ſame time, but with the ſame Oil. For firſt he ſays, <hi>Moſes</hi> took <hi>the anointing Oil;</hi> and ſhows how it was employed after a different manner, upon the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and its Utenſils, upon the Altar, and upon <hi>Aaron;</hi> on whoſe Head it was <hi>poured;</hi> whereas the former had it only put upon them with the finger, or were ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with it. But though they were not Conſecrated together, yet their Conſecration immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another. For <hi>ſeven</hi> days being ſpent in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Tabernacle and the Altar, then immediately began the ſanctification of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons: during which time <hi>Moſes</hi> may be ſuppoſed to have received the foregoing Laws about Sacrifices; in which they were to be employed, as ſoon as they were Conſecrated. And the <hi>ſeven</hi> days for the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, immediately ſucceeding the other ſeven days which were ſpent in the Conſecration of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and the Altar; it may be the reaſon why they here are ſuccinctly mentioned both together; and neither of them mentioned before. For if the account we have in the XL<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Exodus</hi> concerning theſe things, be well attended to, it will appear that nothing is there ſaid of the anointing of the Tabernacle, or any thing elſe; but only that he ſet it up the firſt day of the Month, as he was commanded (<hi>v.</hi> 2, &amp;c. and 17, &amp;c.) And he is commanded in like manner to take the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oil, and anoint the Tabernacle and all therein, (<hi>v.</hi> 9, &amp;c.) and then to anoint <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, (<hi>v.</hi> 13, 15.) but he relates nothing of his doing either of them, till now; when he executed thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>

                  <hi>And poured out the blood at the bottom of the Altar, and ſanctified it,</hi> &amp;c.] The vulgar Latin, I think, gives the true interpretation of theſe words, rather than tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates them; in this manner: <hi>It being expiated and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, he poured out the blood at the bottom of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fort.

Yet we do not find that the Blood of this Sacrifice was carried into the holy place; and therefore it did not fall under the Rule in the VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this Book, <hi>v.</hi> 30. but might have been eaten by the Prieſts, as is there allowed, <hi>v.</hi> 26. Some think it ſufficient, for the ſolution of this, to ſay that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were not yet compleatly Conſecrated, and therefore had not a right to eat of the Fleſh of this Sin-offering. But ſuch Perſons do not conſider that <hi>Moſes,</hi> who now acted as a Prieſt, could not be debarred of that benefit, by this reaſon. And therefore it is better to ſay, that no High-Prieſt, whether ordinary or extraordinary (ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> now was) might eat of any Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, offered for the Prieſts themſelves; although the Blood of it was not brought into the Sanctuary. From whence we may draw this Conſequence, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Sins of the People, were taken away by the Prieſts, who by eating of their Sin-offering, plainly ſhowed that they <hi>bare their ſin,</hi> (as the phraſe is X. 17.) yet the Sins of the Prieſts themſelves could not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, by any Sacrifice they could offer for ſin, of which they might not eat: But they were to expect,

But theſe Legal Sacrifices in the mean time were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch a place, as prefigured the place where this better Sacrifice ſhould be offered, <hi>viz.</hi> without the Camp: as when they came to their reſt, without the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where our Saviour's Body was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our Redemption.</p>

This ſhows the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all the Legal Sacrifices; which would not have been ſo often repeated, if they had been of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er efficacy: Yet the continuance of them <hi>ſeven days</hi> doth ſignifie, the compleat Conſecration of theſe Prieſts; according to the Rites of thoſe times.

But the Sabbath of the LORD did never ſo exactly paſs over any High-Prieſt in his Conſecration, as it did over the High-Prieſt of the New Teſtament. For however it were of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s, it was to our bleſſed Saviour (as the fore-named Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> notes) a Day of Reſt indeed after ſix days of Labour, Watching, Praying and Faſting, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in his bloody Death and Paſſion.</p>

The Hebrew Doctors have here raiſed a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty about the neceſſary Eaſements of Nature; for which they had no convenience, if they might not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52830:65"/>ſtir for ſeven days, from the door of the Tabernacle: and therefore they fancy, there was a hole digged in the Ground for ſuch occaſions. But it is more likely, they were not ſo confined, as not to be allowed this liberty: and one cannot well doubt of it, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the word <hi>Miſmoroth</hi> here uſed, (which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>keep the charge</hi> of the LORD) which is a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary phraſe, ſignifying the Stations and Watches kept, in their turns, for certain hours: after which they were at liberty to attend their own Affairs. Such was the charge here, one may reaſonably think, of not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the door of the Tabernacle, while they were upon the guard (as we ſpeak) which ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them kept night and day; in ſuch order, that while ſome watched, others might ſleep, or ſtep out about the neceſſary occaſions of Nature.</p>

But this was neceſſary, to make thoſe ſerious and intent upon their buſineſs, who were to ſave the Lives of others, by making Expiation for them, when they deſerved to periſh.</p>

               <p>

To confirm this, it may be noted; that, as the place which God choſe for his Worſhip and Service, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward deſigned in the time of <hi>David</hi> after the very ſame manner, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXI. 26. So it was at the time of the <hi>Evening Sacrifice,</hi> as may be gathered from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXIV. 15. where it is ſaid the Peſtilence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from Morning, <hi>to the time appointed,</hi> that is, to the Evening; and then <hi>David</hi> ſaw the Angel, who commanded <hi>Gad</hi> to bid him ſet up the Altar in the Threſhing-floor of <hi>Araunah;</hi> where God anſwering him by fire from Heaven, it made him ſay, <hi>This is the Houſe of God, and this is the Altar of Burnt-offering,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XX. II. 1. And when <hi>Solomon</hi> built the Temple in that very place, it was thus conſecrated by
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52830:71"/>fire coming from Heaven, and conſuming the Burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacrifice, as well as by the Glory of the LORD filling the Houſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> VII. 1, 2, 3. And it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable alſo, that this was at the time of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Sacrifice:</hi> for the former part of the day had been ſpent in bringing the Ark into the Houſe of the LORD, and in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Prayer; as we read in the two foregoing Chapters. Certain it is, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Elijah</hi> to reſtore God's true Religion and Worſhip, was thus juſtified, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> XVIII. 38, 39. and it was at the time of the offering the <hi>Evening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, v.</hi> 36. From whence that Prayer of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, CXLI <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Let the lifting up of my hands be as the evening ſacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this was ſo notorious, that <hi>Julian</hi> himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that fire came down from Heaven in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and again in the days of <hi>Elijah,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, conſuming the Sacrifices; as we find his words related by St. <hi>Cyril, L.</hi> X. <hi>contra Julianum.</hi> And this gave ſuch a Divine Authority to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, that it is no wonder to find, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> indeavoured to get credit to their Religion, by the like reports of fire, from an inviſible Power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming their Sacrifices: which perhaps was ſometimes really done by the Prince of the Power of the Air, as the Apoſtle calls the Devil. However that be, there are ſeveral Inſtances of this in <hi>Pauſanias, Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus, Valerius Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Pliny.</hi> But <hi>Servius</hi> may ſerve inſtead of all; who upon thoſe words of <hi>Virgil</hi> in <hi>Aeneid.</hi> XII.
<q>—faedera fulmine ſancit,</q> ſaith, that anciently they did not kindle fires upon their Altars, <hi>ſed ignem divinum precibus eliciebant,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52830:71"/>but they procured by their Prayers Divine fire, which inflamed their Altars. And <hi>Solinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>cap.</hi> 11. that the flame ſprung out of the Wood by a Divine Power. <hi>Si Deus adeſt, ſi ſacrum probatur, Sarmenta licet viridia ignem ſponte concipiunt,</hi> &amp;c. If God be preſent, if the Sacrifice be acceptable, the Faggots, though green, kindle of themſelves; and without any one to ſet them on fire, a flame is raiſed by the Deity to whom the Sacrifice is offered. Thus <hi>there roſe up fire out of the rock,</hi> and conſumed <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Sacrifice, VI <hi>Judg.</hi> 21. They that would ſee more of this out of <hi>Pagan</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, may conſult <hi>J. Dilherrus Diſſert. Special. de Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelia Gentil. cap.</hi> 11.

               <p>But whether this Fire which now came from before the LORD conſumed <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Sacrifice inſtantly, or only ſet it into a flame, which conſumed it leiſurely in the ſight of all the People, cannot certainly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. The Jews ſeem to ſuppoſe the latter; the heavenly fire being now kindled, which continued e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after by a conſtant ſupply of Fewel, whereby it was kept perpetually burning, as is ordained VI. 12, 13. See Note on that place. Where to me it ſeems very obſervable, that this Law of keeping in the fire perpetually, is ordered to be put in execution at the Evening Sacrifice, <hi>v.</hi> 9. of that Chapter. Which is a ſufficient Reaſon to incline one to think, that the Celeſtial Fire now came, as I have ſuppoſed, at the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Sacrifice, and conſumed the Burnt-offering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which when all the people ſaw, they ſhouted.]</hi> They fled not from it, as Men affrighted, but ſhouted for joy: or, as <hi>Abarbanel</hi>'s phraſe is, <hi>they lifted up their voices with ſinging, and prayed to God,</hi> or rather praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. Juſt as they did when the Fire came down at the Conſecration of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, <hi>When the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52830:72"/>people ſaw it, they praiſed the LORD, ſaying, for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever,</hi> 2 Chron. VII. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And fell on their faces.]</hi> Worſhipped God, with humble Thankfulneſs; who hereby teſtified his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence among them, and his gracious Acceptance of them. For thus he had of old ſhowed his Reſpect to <hi>Abel,</hi> IV <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. and to <hi>Noah,</hi> VII. 20. and to their Father <hi>Abraham;</hi> whoſe Sacrifice was thus accepted in the <hi>Evening,</hi> when the Sun went down, XV <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>And there was great reaſon that both Prieſts and People ſhould rejoyce at this ſight: For, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Book <hi>Coſri</hi> diſcourſes (<hi>Pars</hi> III. <hi>ſect.</hi> 53.)
<q>if a Man look only at the foregoing part of the Work of this day (the killing of the Sacrifices, the Blood running about their hands, their ſlaying of them, waſhing the Entrails, rinſing the Pieces of the Fleſh, ſprinkling the Blood, laying the Wood in order, kindling the Fire) they would rather ſet his Mind further off from God, than draw it near to him: till after all theſe things performed orderly, he ſaw the Fire coming down from Heaven, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God's gracious acceptance of the Sacrifice; or felt another Spirit excited in him, beyond any thing he was acquainted withal before; or had Divine Dreams, or Heroical Motions; which he believed were the Effects of what he had been doing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And no doubt, all good Men, in future Ages, felt their Minds raiſed, by the thoughts that the Sacrifices they offered, were as acceptable to God, as that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this time; being conſumed, in ſome ſort, by the ſame Fire, which burnt continually on this Altar; and after this day was never extinguiſhed till the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.

                  <hi>Took either of them his Cenſer.]</hi> Here are two of their Errors expreſſed in theſe words, if <hi>Abarbanel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture aright, (who ſuppoſes this to have hapned on the laſt day of their Conſecration, when Fire came down from Heaven) <hi>First,</hi> That they adventured, without any order from God, to go and burn Incenſe in the Sanctuary. For though this did not belong to the Office of the High-Prieſt alone, yet upon this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Day <hi>Aaron</hi> only was commanded to perform the whole Service; as upon the Day of Expiation, IX. 7. And this account <hi>Bochartus</hi> gives of their Offence, that <hi>ſine vocatione, thus obtulerunt,</hi> they offered Incenſe,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52830:73"/>without any call to it, <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 49. <hi>p.</hi> 557. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> both of them went about this Work, whereas the Incenſe was to be offered only by one; and not by two at a time. <hi>Procopius Gazaeus</hi> adds a third Error, that they attempt this, out of the due ſeaſon for it: which was only in the Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And put fire thereon.]</hi> As the Prieſts were required to offer <hi>no ſtrange Incenſe,</hi> XXX <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. ſo, in all reaſon, they were to think, it was not to be offered with <hi>ſtrange fire;</hi> but only with a Coal from that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, where there was a fire kindled by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And offered ſtrange fire before the LORD.]</hi> Here are two ſins more (if <hi>Abarbanel</hi> take it right) that they brought Fire from another place, without the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary; and did not take it from the Altar: and then, that they attempted to go into the <hi>most holy place;</hi> which he thinks is ſignified by theſe words, <hi>before the LORD.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> of theſe is the Opinion alſo of <hi>Aben-Ezra,</hi> and other learned Men among the Jews; who by ſtrange fire underſtand, <hi>fire that did not go out from before the LORD,</hi> IX. 24. that is, was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Altar of Burnt-offering; where Fire from Heaven lately conſumed their Oblations. And ſo <hi>R. Bechai:</hi>
                  <q>They imagined that the Fire on the Altar of Burnt-offerings, was only for conſuming Sacrifices; and therefore they fetcht ſome from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, for the burning Incenſe.</q> But as to the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing, it doth not ſeem to me probable; for <hi>Aaron</hi> himſelf had not yet gone into the <hi>Holy of Holies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which he commanded them not.]</hi> This they did (ſaith <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi>) from their own proper Motion and Opinion; without any Authority from God: for whoſe order they ſhould have waited, if his Mind
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52830:73"/>was not already ſufficiently declared, as it was fully afterwards XVI. 12.</p>
               <p>How two ſuch excellent Men as theſe (who had had the honour to be called up to God, when he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and to have a ſight of him, and to eat and drink in his Preſence, XXIV <hi>Exod.</hi> 1, 9, 10, &amp;c.) came to be ſo raſh, and to fall ſo unadviſedly into ſo great an Error, as this here mentioned, cannot be certainly reſolved. But it ſeems to me highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that at the Feaſt upon the <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> they had eaten and drunk too liberally; which made them forget themſelves, and fall into this groſs miſtake. For I can ſee no other reaſon, why that Command <hi>v.</hi> 8. of not drinking Wine or ſtrong Drink, when the Prieſts were to go into the Sanctuary, is annexed unto this ſtory of their Death and Burial; but only this, which I have now alledged; that their Miſcarriage aroſe from drinking too much Wine, before this Office was to be performed.</p>

                  <hi>And there went out fire from the LORD.]</hi> As they were entring into the Sanctuary, or as they ſtood at the Golden Altar ready to offer Incenſe; Fire came out from the moſt Holy Place (where the Glory of the LORD was) and ſtruck them dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And devoured them.]</hi> It did not reduce their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to Aſhes, nor ſo much as burn their Clothes, (<hi>v.</hi> 5.) but they were killed, as Men ſometimes are with Lightning; which penetrates into the Vital Parts, and puts a ſudden end to their Life. That's meant here by <hi>devoured them;</hi> took away their Breath in a moment. From which Expreſſion the Hebrew Doctors conclude, that when any body was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be burnt, it was not to be conſumed to Aſhes, but only exanimated by the Fire; becauſe this
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52830:74"/>is called <hi>devouring</hi> or <hi>burning,</hi> here in this place. See <hi>Gamera Sanhedrim, cap.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 1.</p>

                  <hi>And they died before the LORD.]</hi> Fell down dead in the Houſe of God. Which may ſeem too great a Severity, till it be conſidered, how reaſonable and neceſſary it was, to inflict a heavy Puniſhment upon the firſt Tranſgreſſors of a Law, concerning a Matter of great moment, to deter others from the like Offence. Many inſtances of which there are in Scripture: Some obſerved by St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> upon VI <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. where he gives this account, why the Man who gathered a few ſticks upon the Sabbath-day, was adjudged to be ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as Blaſphemers were; becauſe it was a very hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous thing, <gap reason="foreign">

XVI <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. who having the honour of attending upon the Service of the Divine Majeſty, were bound to approach into his Preſence, with the greateſt Reverence. We do not read indeed thoſe very words, which <hi>Moſes</hi> here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites, in the foregoing Books: But, as many things were ſpoken to them, which are not recorded, ſo the ſenſe of theſe words are in the place forenamed, XIX <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. and the reaſon of them, in XXIX <hi>Exod.</hi> 43, 44. where the Tabernacle being ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified</hi> by the Divine Glory, and the Prieſts being <hi>ſanctified</hi> to miniſter unto him therein (which was ſeven days a doing, as we read here VIII. 35.) they were plainly taught to draw nigh to God with a holy Fear, and to do nothing raſhly, nor without order from him. For God being peculiarly known by the Name of the <hi>Holy One,</hi> i. e. who hath incomparable Perfections, ſuch as no other Being hath; he juſtly required to be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly worſhipped, ſutable to his moſt ſurpaſſing Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; by peculiar Rites of his own preſcribing, in a different manner from all other Beings. It was, for inſtance, below his Emenency, or rather Supereminent Majeſty, to have common Fire (ſuch as they imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Kitchins) uſed for the burning Sacrifice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Altar. And in like manner all other parts of his Service were, in reaſon, to be performed after ſuch a faſhion, as might ſignifie their ſenſe of the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Excellencies of the Divine Nature; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent Fire from Heaven, as only fit to burn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually upon his Altar.</p>

Or the meaning is, if they who draw nigh to me, will not ſanctifie me, I will vindicate my own honour, by ſuch Puniſhments, as ſhall openly declare to all, that I am the <hi>Holy One.</hi> Thus God is ſaid to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> by drowning him in the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, XIV <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52830:76"/>And the time of their letting their Hair grow on ſuch occaſions, they determine by the Law of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> who were not to cut their Hair all the time of their Vow of Separation, which the Jews ſay was at leaſt XXX days, VI <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. Therefore the Prieſts were not to let their Hair grow ſo long: if they did, they were uncapable of officiating. Only they make this difference between the common Prieſts, and the High-Prieſt; that this Law did not bind the Prieſts at all times, but only in their Courſe of Miniſtration: but the High-Prieſt (whoſe Preſence was always ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the Sanctuary) might never let his Hair grow; but was bound every Week to have it cut even, on the Eve of the Sabbath. See <hi>Selden L.</hi> II. <hi>de Succeſſ. in Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff. cap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>But the foundation of all this is not very ſtrong; for it relies chiefly on the uſe of the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in that place of <hi>Numbers</hi> VI. 5. where it ſignifies <hi>Hair:</hi> from whence they conclude the <hi>Verb</hi> here may have the ſame Notion, and ſignifie the <hi>growth of Hair.</hi> But this is not the uſual ſignification of it in Scripture, where it commonly imports the <hi>rejection</hi> of ſomething; as of good <hi>Counſel,</hi> I <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. of <hi>Reproof</hi> or <hi>Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> XIII <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. XV. 32. And being joyned with the <hi>Head,</hi> plainly ſignifies the <hi>uncovering it.</hi> See V <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. And therefore ſo the LXX. underſtand it here; as if they were forbidden to <hi>put off their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</hi> But that they always did, as ſoon as they had performed their Sacred Office in the Sanctuary: and therefore it may be meant of making their Heads <hi>bare</hi> by ſhaving them, or <hi>bald</hi> by pulling off the Hair, as the manner was in Mourning, XV <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. XLI <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. XLVIII. 37. and many other places. And in this, the Prieſts among the <hi>Jews</hi> directly oppoſed thoſe among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> who ſhaved their Heads, as appears by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52830:76"/>what <hi>Minutius Faelix,</hi> and <hi>Lampridius,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Commodus,</hi> ſay, concerning the Prieſts of <hi>Iſis.</hi> And <hi>Herodotus</hi> alſo in his <hi>Euterpe,</hi> whoſe words are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Neither rend your Clothes.]</hi> Which was another Rite of Mourning; not only among the Jews, but among all People in ancient Times, eſpecially in the Eaſtern Countries; as every one knows that hath read any of their Authors. See I <hi>Job</hi> 20. And it was uſed on many other occaſions among the Jews, as well as in their Funerals; particularly when any Man blaſphemed, XIV <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> XIX. 1. when any ill Tidings came, which put them into a Paſſion, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> V. 7. or any Misfortune befel them, XLIV <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. XI <hi>Judg.</hi> 35. But was thought ſo unſeemly in a Prieſt, eſpecially when he miniſtred, that the Jews ſay, they whoſe Garments were rent by accident, were as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of miniſtring, as they who rent them themſelves in Mourning.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this Precept was (as <hi>R.

               <p>
                  <hi>Lest ye die.]</hi> As <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> did. For after ſuch a Monition as this, they had highly diſhonoured God, if they had appeared in his Sanctuary in ſuch an indecent manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And wrath come upon the people.]</hi> For want of Prieſts, to make atonement for them, when they offended.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:52830:77"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let your brethren, the whole houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.]</hi> He doth not prohibit the reſt of the People, who were not Prieſts, to mourn for them; but rather requires it of them all: that they might be ſenſible of their loſs, and of the the ſin which was the cauſe of it. And it is likely the People bewailed them, by rending their Clothes, and baring their Heads, and putting Aſhes upon them; or, ſome ſuch Rites, then in uſe among them.</p>

                  <hi>And ye ſhall not go out from the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</hi> For it is ſuppoſed the <hi>ſeven</hi> days of their Conſecration were not yet quite ended, (VIII. 35.) or they had begun ſome other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in the Sanctuary; and therefore were not to ſtir out of the Court of it, till it was ſanctified. And the <hi>Hebrews</hi> think this Law did not only bind <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, at this time; but their Poſterity for ever: that if they heard of the death of any of their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, when they were miniſtring in the Sanctuary, they ſhould not ſtir from their Duty: For that would have been to ſhow a greater affection to a dead Friend, than to the living God. This appears to be true, by the like command to this, and in the ſame words, laid particularly upon the High-Prieſts, XXI. 12.</p>

For it would have been a declaration, that there was ſomething in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52830:77"/>the World more to be regarded, than God's Service. And therefore the puniſhment of Death is threatned (in the foregoing words) to thoſe who were guilty of ſuch an offence.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And if I had eaten the ſin-offering to day, ſhould it have been accepted in the ſight of the LORD?</hi>] Would God have been pleaſed with me, if in ſuch Sadneſs and Sorrow, I had eaten of the Sacrifice? This is the reaſon whereby he juſtifies the omiſſion of which his Sons were accuſed; in not eating the Sin-offering in the Holy Place. The blame of which he takes upon himſelf; for to have eaten it with a ſad Countenance and a heavy Heart, he thought would have been to pollute it. And therefore he choſe to forbear it, and to give it wholly to God, by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fleſh of it, as he had done the Fat; which he hoped would be more acceptable, than to eat it in grief. And to eat it without grief and ſorrow was impoſſible: for though they had not been ſo dutiful to him, as they ought to have been; yet he could not extinguiſh the Affection of a Father towards them, nor ſuddenly ceaſe to mourn inwardly for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death.</p>

And ſome have thought this ſo unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they have ſaid it is in vain to enquire into the reaſon of the difference that is made here of Meats: concerning which <hi>P.

But others think the reaſon is plain enough; and the Jews are of opinion that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, here called <hi>unclean,</hi> were forbidden to be eaten, becauſe they were unwholſome Food. So <hi>Maimonides</hi> diſcourſes at large, in his <hi>More Nevoch.

R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barcelona</hi> is of the ſame mind, but pretends not to be able to demonſtrate it as <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:52830:82"/>doth. For the Sum of a long and pious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which he hath upon this Subject (<hi>Praecept.</hi> LXXIX. where he treats of that Fleſh which was torn by wild Beaſts) amounts to this:
<q>That the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Seat of the Soul, where it doth its buſineſs, God would have it fitted to the Deſires and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Soul. And therefore the Law, ſaith he, removes from us all thoſe things which may hinder the Soul in its operations. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuch and ſuch Meats are forbidden, as breed ill Blood: among which, if there be ſome whoſe hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is neither viſible to us, nor to Phyſicians, do not wonder at it; for <hi>the faithful Phyſician who forbids them, is wiſer than any of us.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This opinion I cannot think to be wholly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: for though there be ſome Creatures here prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, which ſeem to us of as good Nouriſhment, as thoſe which are allowed; yet conſidering that Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate wherein the Jews lived, and the temper of their Blood, which was very hot, and apt to be extreamly corrupted, (as appears by the unuſual Leproſie to which they were obnoxious, more than other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) it is reaſonable to conclude that God had ſome reſpect to this, in the ordering of their Diet. See <hi>J. Wagenſeil Confut. Carminis R. Lipmanni, p.</hi> 556. Yet I cannot think this to have been the chief reaſon of this Law (though it be very agreeable to the peculiar care God had of this People, that he ſhould not only give them Civil and Sacred Laws, but direct them in the ſmalleſt Matters, as he did in their <hi>Apparel, Building,</hi> &amp;c.) but the main drift and ſcope of it was, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might be ſeparated from all other Nations in the World, by a Diet peculiar to themſelves: which kept them from ſuch a familiar Converſation, as otherwiſe they might have had with the <hi>Gentiles;</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:52830:83"/>and conſequently from learning their idolatrous Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms. And I do not ſee why I ſhould not add, moſt of the Creatures, which are reckoned <hi>unclean,</hi> were ſuch as were in high eſteem and ſacred among the Heathen. As a <hi>Swine</hi> was to <hi>Venus,</hi> the <hi>Owl</hi> to <hi>Minerva,</hi> the <hi>Hawk</hi> to <hi>Apollo,</hi> the <hi>Eagle</hi> to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and even the <hi>Dog</hi> to <hi>Hecate,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52830:88"/>they did not eat it. But others take it more largely, that they ſhould not ſo much as open them, to take out the Fat, and apply it to any uſe. In this the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſo ſcrupulous, that they ſay they may not touch them (though alive) with one of their Fingers, for fear of the Leproſie. It being a Proverbial ſaying among them, which we read in the Treatiſe <hi>Kidduſchin,</hi> That <hi>ten meaſures of Leproſie deſcending into the World, Swine took to themſelves nine of them, and the rest of the World one.</hi>

               <p>If we may believe <hi>Herodotus, Lib.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 47. the <hi>Egyptians</hi> lookt upon Swine as ſo unclean, that if any one touched one of them by chance, as he paſſed by, he was bound to waſh himſelf, with his Garments, in the River. Certain it is, that not only they, but the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and ſome other neighbouring Nations, did abſtain from Swines fleſh, as <hi>Bochartus</hi> and others have obſerved, (See his <hi>Hierozoicon.</hi> P.I. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 57. <hi>p.</hi> 702. and <hi>Petr.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Locust after its kind.]</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boh</hi> is ſometimes a common Name for all Locuſts; but here ſignifies a peculiar ſort, of that kind before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which leapt, as well as went.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The bald Locust after its kind.]</hi> The Hebrew word is <hi>Solam:</hi> ſo called, as <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> thinks, becauſe it climbs up Roots, in which it delights.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Beetle after its kind.]</hi> This ſort of Locuſt, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chargol,</hi> ſeems to have its name from the vaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany wherein they fly together. But it is not fitly tranſlated a <hi>Beetle;</hi> for none ever eat Beetles; nor are they four-footed, with legs to leap withal. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chargol</hi> is another ſort of Locuſts, unknown to us in theſe Countries; and ſo is that which follows; for a <hi>Graſhopper</hi> is not a ſort of Meat: But there were Locuſts of that ſhape, which were large and fleſhy in the Eaſtern Countries, and very good Food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Graſhopper after its kind.]</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Chagab</hi> ſignifies (as I ſaid) a ſort of Locuſts, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of whoſe Name <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> intimates may be found in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue. In which <hi>Chahageba</hi> ſignifies to cover as with a Vail: And in ſuch Troops theſe Locuſts fly, that ſometimes they ſeem to darken the Sun it ſelf. But by what marks theſe were diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one another, the Hebrews differ ſo much, that it plainly ſnows they are wholly ignorant in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The moſt that can be made of what they ſay, is, (as a Man very learned in theſe things hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, (<hi>Job Ludolphus</hi> in his Diſſertation <hi>de Locuſtis, P.</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 23.) that <hi>Chargol</hi> hath both a bunch on its back, and a Tail alſo: <hi>Arbeh</hi> hath neither: <hi>Solam</hi> only a Bunch, and not a Tail; and <hi>Chagab</hi> a Tail, but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52830:93"/>no Bunch. Which, whether it be true or falſe, it doth not much concern us to know. But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that before our Saviour's time, they knew very well and certainly, what kind of Locuſts are here meant; and accordingly perfectly underſtood what they might eat, and what not. For otherwiſe <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> would have been hard put to it, who had no other Diet but this and Honey. And indeed in deſert places, there was little other Food but this; by which whole Armies of Men have been relieved, when they were in danger to periſh in <hi>Libya.</hi> For that Locuſts were a common Food in the Eaſtern and Southern Countries, is ſo known, that I need not produce any Authorities for it. Nay, among the <hi>Greeks</hi> alſo, as <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath ſhown in his <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> II. <hi>L.</hi> IV. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. And <hi>Voſſius, L.</hi> IV. <hi>de Orig. &amp; Progr. Idol. c.</hi> 78. But no Body hath given ſuch ſatisfaction in this matter, as the fore-named <hi>Ludolphus;</hi> who hath ſhown at large how many Nations live upon them, in his Commentary upon his <hi>Aethiopick Hiſtory:</hi> and more lately in his moſt excellent <hi>Diſſertation</hi> concerning <hi>Locuſts.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he relates what Clouds of them came into <hi>Germany</hi> not long ago (in the Month of <hi>August,</hi> in the Year One thouſand ſix hundred ninety and three) of which he ſeeing Hogs and Hens and other Creatures feeding greedily, he and his Family adventured to eat freely of them alſo; and found the taſte of them like that of a <hi>Crab.</hi> And a Jew of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> who was then in their Country, aſſured him that the Locuſts in <hi>Judea</hi> were much of the ſame ſhape with theſe in <hi>Germany;</hi> which he demonſtrated to him by a draught he had made of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After his kind.]</hi> Here it may be fit to note, in the concluſion of all, that this phraſe, <hi>after his kind,</hi> (which is ſo often repeated in this Diſcourſe of <hi>Fowls</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:52830:94"/>and <hi>flying things</hi>) doth not neceſſarily ſignifie that there are different kinds of every Bird or flying thing to which it is applied; but only imports <hi>every one of that kind.</hi> For he doth not ſpeak in the Plural Number, <hi>according to their kinds;</hi> but in the Singular, <hi>after his kind:</hi> which only denotes that the whole <hi>Species</hi> is prohibited. And what he ſaith of ſome <hi>Fowls,</hi> is in reaſon to be applied to all; though, to avoid repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he doth not add theſe words <hi>[after his kind]</hi> to every one of them.</p>

See <hi>Bochart. Hieroz. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> IV. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all that can be ſaid, it muſt be acknowledged the ſignifications of all theſe words are loſt among the Jews; as <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> confeſſes upon this Verſe: <hi>Neither theſe eight ſorts of creeping things, nor the Birds before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are known to us, but by Tradition.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, they are not known at all; for there is no Tradition about them, as the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; who ſend thoſe who are doubtful what Birds are lawful, and what not, to be informed by thoſe that are Maſters of the Art of <hi>Fowling.</hi> Which might help to convince the Jews, were they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſhut their Eyes, that difference of Meats is now ceaſed, becauſe they know not what is forbidden, and what not, in many caſes. And conſequently the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come, to whom the <hi>gathering of the people</hi> was to be, (according to their Father <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, XLIX <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.) ſo that they ſhould be no longer ſeparated, but all Nations collected into one Body, and converſe freely together, without any danger of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52830:96"/>being defiled. For Idolatry being aboliſhed by him, there was no reaſon remaining for keeping up the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination between Jews and Gentles, by a different Diet. This ſome of the ancient Jews ſaw very well, who ſaid, that in the days of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> it ſhould not be unlawful to eat <hi>Swines-fleſh,</hi> no more then it was while they were ſubduing the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> This Tradition is acknowledged by <hi>Abarbanel</hi> himſelf in his <hi>Roſch Amanah,</hi> where he diſputes for the Eternity of their Law, and indeavours to elude this Tradition of the ancient Doctors by Allegorical Interpretations. See <hi>J. Carzovius</hi> in <hi>Schickard. Miſchpat hammelech, c.</hi> 5. <hi>Theorem</hi> XVIII.</p>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52830:102"/>But there being great reaſon to prohibit them, it was very neceſſary that both Prieſts and People ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and be well skilled in, the Marks whereby what was lawful to be eaten, might be known from what was unlawful.

XIV. 57.) in which there was ſome difficulty; and therefore they are charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God himſelf to attend carefully to the Laws he gave about them. But there was no ſuch difficulty in what belong'd to the Purification of Women; and therefore it was ſufficient that they received Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning it.</p>

                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:52830:103"/>days, as they in the other Caſe by <hi>thirty and three.</hi> The reaſon of which difference, not only the Jews, but others alſo derive from the greater redundancy (as <hi>R. Levi Barcelonita</hi> calls it, <hi>Praecept.</hi> CLXVI.) of Blood in the latter Caſe, than in the former; and from the flowneſs of Nature in its operation, which made the Purgation longer before it was effected. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf treats of this difference (in his Book <hi>de Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Puerp.</hi>) where he ſaith, Women are ſooner purged after the Birth of Males, than of Females: See <hi>Joh. Meurſius</hi> in his <hi>Syntagma de Puerperio, cap.</hi> 6, 7. The natural weakneſſes of Women alſo, during this time, required quiet and little Company: from which the very temper of their Blood in thoſe Climates made a longer Separation more neceſſary, than in theſe colder Regions. But if there were no ſuch apparent reaſon to be given of theſe things, yet <hi>vel ex ipſa veneranda antiquitate, &amp; ſimplicitate ſuſcipienda forent, &amp; minimè contemnenda</hi> (as <hi>Conrad.

Where, by this Offering ſhe alſo commended her ſelf and Child to his continued Care and Bleſſing, and implored his Divine Guidance and Aſſiſtance in its Education. For theſe <hi>Offerings,</hi> as I obſerved before, were a kind of Supplication which they that brought them made to God: and there was nothing that pious People could more earneſtly deſire on ſuch occaſions, than that God would take their little ones into his tuition. Who are continually liable to ſo many Dangers, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpecial Favour of God, and the Cuſtody of his Angels, they could never grow to be able to take any care of themſelves. They are the words of <hi>Conra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Pellicanus</hi> upon this place; who thence infers how neceſſary it is, that the People of the Church ſhould be admoniſhed frequently, to commend their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto God both by private and by publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and take care of their Inſtruction, <hi>lest they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like the Horſe, and the Mule, that have no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>

                  <hi>And a young Pigeon, or a turtle Dove for a ſin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.]</hi> To compleat her Purification from her Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For that is here meant by <hi>Sin;</hi> the impurity which the Law made, by Separating ſuch Perſons from others, and from the Sanctuary, for a time. And thus a <hi>Sin-offering</hi> is commanded to be brought by a <hi>Leper,</hi> when he was cleanſed; who was charged only with a Legal Uncleanneſs, not a Moral. And it is more plain, from what is ordained concerning <hi>menſtruous Women,</hi> whoſe Courſes were purely natural, and yet they were to offer a <hi>Sin-offering</hi> when they were gone, XV. 30. becauſe the Law accounted that a ſtate of Uncleanneſs.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52830:104"/>And from the caſe of a <hi>Nazaarite,</hi> who had unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly touched a dead Body, V <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. where it is ſaid, he had <hi>ſinned by the dead;</hi> i.e. was legally pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted. And this may be the reaſon, perhaps, why a <hi>Burnt-offering</hi> is here mentioned before the <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> which is wont to precede the other, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8.</p>
               <p>It may be conceived indeed that in all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Caſes, thoſe Perſons (eſpecially <hi>Lepers</hi>) had ſome way offended God, before or in their ſtate of Separation; and therefore were to have their ſin (properly ſo called) expiated by a <hi>Sin-offering.</hi> And <hi>R. Bechai</hi> alſo gives another probable account of it; that this Sacrifice was offered not for her own Sin, but the Sin of her firſt Parent, the Mother of all Living, who brought Sin and Sorrow into the World: for from a bad Stock, there cannot ſprout good Branches; and therefore God appointed this Offering for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of that primary Sin.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52830:106"/>Leper: whom therefore they lookt upon as ſmitten by God; and thence called the Diſeaſe the <hi>Plague,</hi> or ſtroke, <hi>of Leproſie,</hi> and ſometimes ſimply the <hi>Plague</hi> or <hi>Stroke,</hi> v. 3, 5, 17, 22. of this Chapter.

After which, the Man ſtretcht out his right Arm, and the Prieſt put ſome of the ſame Blood upon the Thumb of his right Hand: and next, his right Leg, on the great Toe of which he likewiſe put ſome more Blood. Thus <hi>Maimonides</hi> in the ſame place. Where he ſaith, If the Prieſt had put the Blood upon the left Ear, Thumb, or Toe, all had been of no effect. And he adds, (<hi>ſect.</hi> 5.) that the Blood was put upon half of the flap of his Ear; and upon the whole breadth of the top of his Thumb, and great Toe; for if he put it on the ſides, or beneath, it was ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Which is very reaſonable to believe, becauſe there was no natural efficacy in theſe things to cleanſe a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but it depended wholly upon the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, which was punctually therefore to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; that by the exact performance of all theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Signs (as <hi>Pellicanus</hi> ſpeaks) in the face of the Church, all Men might be ſatisfied that he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly purified; and he might be publickly authorized to aſſociate himſelf with the reſt of God's People, and be no longer abominated by them for his impurity. For the ſignification of theſe Ceremonies ſome think to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52830:121"/>have been, that he was reſtored to free Communion with God, and with Man. See XXIX <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. And <hi>Abarbanel</hi> looks upon them as a ſignification alſo, that the Leproſie began in thoſe parts of the Body (which are leſs fleſhy and fat) and were now therefore par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly declared clean. But whatever the intention of them was, there was a juſt and wiſe reaſon, no doubt, for them; though at this diſtance from thoſe Ages, Countries, and Cuſtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may not be able to diſcover it.</p>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52830:125"/>Clothes of thoſe who have the Peſtilence.

But if he perſiſted in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Courſes, it proceeded to his Houſhold-ſtuff: and if he ſtill went on, it invaded his Garments; and at laſt his Body, <hi>More Nevoch.

<q>That God is ſo very merciful, as not at firſt to inflict Puniſhment on Mens Bodies, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Caſe of <hi>Job;</hi> whoſe Goods were firſt deſtroyed, and then his Children, before his Body was touched. And in the Plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> it ſelf, whoſe Vines and Fig-trees God ſmote, and then their Cattle, before he killed their Firſt-born. In the ſame manner the Plague of Leproſie, firſt invaded a Man's Habitation; though not the whole Houſe, but ſome Stones only, in the beginning of it. Then it ſpread all over, till the Houſe was pulled down.

For there were ſo many ſorts of Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, made by the Law, that it was very hard to avoid falling under ſome of them: and conſequently a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of great care, circumſpection, and labour, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, as they ought, into the Divine Preſence. For if a Man eſcaped defilement by a dead body, yet he could not eaſily avoid being defiled by ſome of the eight creeping things, which he might chance to tread upon; or might fall on his Meat, or his Drink: And if he eſcaped theſe, yet he might be defiled involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily by the means mentioned here <hi>v.</hi> 16. or by touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a menſtruous Woman, or one that had a Flux of Blood; or at leaſt by touching their Bed, their Seats, or ſomething belonging to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which kept a Man from the Sanctuary; which he could not enter therefore when he pleaſed, but was to ſtay a certain time before he could be admitted to worſhip God there; and not then neither till he had waſhed himſelf. <hi>By all which actions, reverence, affection and devotion was preſerved to the Sanctuary; and Men were excited to great humility, which in this was principally regarded.</hi>

But <hi>the Cloud</hi> ſeems to have been on the out-ſide of the Tabernacle; and within a <hi>Glory</hi> or great Splendor only unclouded. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt, I think, underſtand this of the Smoak of the Incenſe, that the High-Prieſt burnt when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the moſt holy place; which was <hi>the Cloud</hi> wherewith the Mercy-ſeat was then covered, <hi>v.</hi> 13. And there is great reaſon for this Opinion: for if there had been a Cloud in the moſt holy place, over the Mercy-ſeat, before the High-Prieſt entred, what need had there been to make a new Cloud of Smoak, (as he is ordered <hi>v.</hi> 13.) when the Divine <hi>Glory</hi> was ſufficiently obſcured already. Beſides, in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned (XL <hi>Exod.</hi>) the <hi>Cloud,</hi> as I now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, is ſaid to be without the Tabernacle, and to cover it; the <hi>Glory</hi> only being within: and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of the Book of <hi>Kings</hi> (and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> V. 13, 14.) it is ſaid only <hi>to fill the Houſe of the LORD, i.e.</hi> the Body of the Temple: but not to be ſettled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mercy-ſeat. Where we may very well doubt whether there was any Cloud, or no; but only the Divine GLORY.

And the Jews ſay, that he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his own Houſe and Family ſeven days before, and dwelt apart from them in a Chamber of the Temple; that he might the better prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the Offices of this day, by ſprinkling the Blood of the daily Sacrifice, burning Incenſe, and ſuch like things. And leſt he ſhould be either ignorant of his Duty, (as ſome proved, in the latter end of their State, when the High-Prieſthood was bought for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) or forgetful, the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> ſent ſome to read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the Rites of this day; who adjured him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to perform every thing according to God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

All this, and a great deal more, is related in <hi>Codex Joma, cap.</hi> 1.

                  <hi>He ſhall put on the holy linen coat,</hi> &amp;c.] There were eight Garments-belonging to the Attire of the High-Prieſt: four of which are here mentioned, which the Jews call his <hi>white Garments;</hi> and <hi>four</hi> more men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned XXVIII <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. which they call the <hi>golden Garments;</hi> becauſe there was a mixture of Gold in them; whereas theſe were all made of fine Linen. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other days, when the High-Prieſt officiated, he was bound to put them on all (not one of the <hi>eight</hi> being wanting) but on this day, when he went in to the moſt holy place, he put on only thoſe four, which were the Habit of the ordinary Prieſts, as well as his. This, ſome conceive, was in token of Humility, becauſe this day was appointed for Confeſſion of Sins, and Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon which account they imagine alſo, theſe Linen Garments were courſer than thoſe which he wore every day with his golden Garments. But all the Jews agree, that theſe Garments, which he wore on the Day of Expiation, were made of the pureſt and moſt precious <hi>Linen</hi> of all other: which they call (in <hi>Maſſechet Joma, cap.</hi> 3.) <hi>fine Linen</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſium,</hi> which was a City in <hi>Egypt,</hi> famous for the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52830:137"/>richeſt and whiteſt Linen, as our <hi>Sheringham</hi> ſhows (in his Notes on that Treatiſe) out of <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Silius Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus.</hi> And if we may believe the <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> as the High-Prieſt put on fine Linen of <hi>Peluſium</hi> in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this day, ſo he put on fine Linen of <hi>India</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> in their Language, of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> or <hi>Arabia,</hi> as <hi>Braunius</hi> obſerves, <hi>Lib.</hi> I. <hi>de Veſt. Sacerd. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 9.) in the evening of it; which was not of much leſs value than the other. And this is not diſagreeable to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſaith God commanded the Prieſts Garments to be made <hi>for glory and beauty,</hi> XXVIII <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. And therefore the High Prieſt appeared even upon this day, in a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and noble Habit; which was not inconſiſtent with inward Humility and Lowlineſs of Mind; whereby the comely and beautiful performance of God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, was not to be obſtructed. For whereas upon other days, the High-Prieſt waſht his hands and his feet in the Braſen Laver; on this day, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Jews,</hi> he waſht them in a Veſſel of Gold, as the ſame <hi>Braunius</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Maſſechet Joma, c.</hi> 4. There are thoſe who fancy the High-Prieſt went into the moſt holy place, with the <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Breaſt-plate,</hi> whereon were the Names of the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> but that is quite contrary to what <hi>Moſes</hi> here delivers, who mentions no other Garments but theſe of fine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen which he wore upon this day; no not when he went into the holy place (<hi>v.</hi> 23.) And the Hebrew Doctors all thus underſtand it, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſhows out of them and <hi>Joſephus, Lib.</hi> II. <hi>de Succeſſion. in Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tific. Hebraeor. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 250.</p>
               <p>Yet the Roman Church hath grounded a ſolemn Practiſe upon the fore-mentioned fancy; the Prieſts, and Biſhops too, being wont on <hi>Good-Friday</hi> to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter only in the Habit of Deacons, while they are reading or ſinging the Office of the Paſſion: But when
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52830:138"/>they come to the Sacrifice of the Maſs (as they call it) then they put on richer Veſtments, proper to their order. Which is a miſtaken Imitation of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies under the Law, upon this great Day of Atonement; when the High-Prieſt never put on any of his golden Garments for the Service of it.</p>

On which the High-Prieſt (as the Hebrew Gloſs notes upon this place) did not ſo much put on the Perſon of a <hi>Patron,</hi> as of an <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer;</hi> Confeſſing their Sins before God, and begging pardon for them.</p>

Or the ſimple reaſon of it might be, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by this double Sacrifice (for both were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before the LORD) might be the more fully ſatisfied of the Expiation of their Sins. There is the like example before, of two Birds appointed for the cleanſing of a Leper's Houſe; one of which only was killed, the other let fly away; but both of them are ſaid to <hi>cleanſe</hi> the Houſe, and to be for <hi>atonement,</hi> XIV. 49, 52, 53.

The High-Prieſt went to the Eaſt-part of the Court, on the North-ſide of the Altar, having the <hi>Sagan</hi> (his Vicar) on his right hand, and the head of the Houſe of the Fathers on his left. There ſtood two <hi>Goats,</hi> with an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn</hi> or Box, which they call <hi>CALPI</hi> (the very ſame name which <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and the Scholiaſt upon <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> give to the ſame thing, as our learned <hi>Sheringham</hi> upon that Book, and <hi>Bochart</hi> in his <hi>Hierozoicon,</hi> have obſerved). Into this Urn the two Lots were caſt, which were made of Box-wood (as the <hi>Miſna</hi> here ſays) and in after times came to be of Gold. But <hi>Maimonides</hi> in his Treatiſe on this Subject, ſaith they might be made either of Wood or Stone, or any Metal; provided one of them was not bigger than the other, (nor one of Gold, the other of Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but both every way equal, as the Goats were to be. Upon one of theſe Lots was written the name of the Goat which was for the LORD; and on the other that which was for <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel.</hi> And then the Prieſt ſhaking the Urn, and putting
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:52830:140"/>in both his hands (as it there follows in <hi>Joma, cap.</hi> 4.) took up a Lot in each. And if he brought up God's Lot in his right hand, the <hi>Sagan,</hi> who ſtood there, ſaid, <hi>My Lord, lift up thy right hand:</hi> If in his left hand, the Head of the Fathers ſaid, <hi>Lift up thy left hand.</hi> And ſo the Prieſt let the right hand Lot fall upon the Goat that ſtood on the right hand; and his left hand lot upon the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One lot for the LORD.]</hi> To be offered unto the LORD at the Altar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The other lot for the ſcape-goat.]</hi> Or, as it is in the Hebrew, for <hi>Azazel;</hi> as ſome have anciently tranſlated it. Now why a <hi>Goat</hi> was offered in Sacrifice, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Goat let go free, laden with their ſins, rather than any other Creature, may be underſtood, perhaps, from the inclination of the Heathen World in thoſe days, when they worſhipped <hi>Daemons</hi> in the form of a Goat. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> were famous for this, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves (it appears from the XVII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Book, <hi>v.</hi> 7.) were prone to offer Sacrifices <hi>le Seirim;</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Daemons</hi> in that form. And therefore to take them off from ſuch Idolatrous Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, God ordained theſe Creatures themſelves to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed and ſlain, to whom they had offered Sacrifice. And the young ones he appointed for this purpoſe, (for ſo <hi>Seirim</hi> ſignifies) which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> moſt of all honoured, and abhorred to offer or kill. So <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Nefas illic foetum jugulare Capellae.</l>

                     </bibl>
                  </q> Now from hence perhaps it was that ſome fancied <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zazel</hi> ſignified the Devil; as <hi>R. Menachem</hi> and <hi>R. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liezer</hi> among the Jews; <hi>Julian</hi> among the Heathen;
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:52830:141"/>and ſome great Men lately among us. Who conceive that as the other Goat was offered to God at the Altar, ſo this was ſent among the Daemons, which delight to frequent deſert places, and there appeared often in the ſhape of this Creature. But this will not agree with the Hebrew Text, which ſays this Goat was for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zazel,</hi> as the other was <hi>for the LORD.</hi> Now none ſure will be ſo prophane, as to imagine, that both theſe Goats being ſet before the LORD, and preſented to him, as equally Conſecrated to him, he would then order one of them to be for himſelf, and the other for the Devil. We muſt therefore be content with our own Tranſlation, which derives the word <hi>Azazel</hi> from <hi>Ez,</hi> a Goat; and <hi>azal,</hi> to go away; and fitly calls it the <hi>Scape-goat:</hi> So <hi>Paulus Fagius,</hi> and a great many others: againſt which I ſee nothing objected, but that <hi>Ez</hi> ſignifies a <hi>ſhe</hi> Goat, not a <hi>he.</hi> Which made <hi>Bochar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> fetch this word from the <hi>Arabick;</hi> in which Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>Azala</hi> ſignifies to <hi>remove,</hi> or to <hi>ſeparate.</hi> And this agrees well enough with the name of this Goat, according as the ancient Tranſlators underſtood it; ſome of which, as <hi>Symmachus,</hi> render it <gap reason="foreign">

But the words, <hi>he ſhall go out,</hi> plainly ſignifie his coming from the Sanctuary, where the golden Altar was (and had been cleanſed, we may well ſuppoſe, together with it, <hi>v.</hi> 16.) into the outward Court, to the Altar of <hi>Burnt-offering,</hi> which was alſo <hi>before the LORD,</hi> (XXIX <hi>Exod.</hi> 11.) though at a greater diſtance from him: and which, one would think, ſtood in need to be cleanſed, as much as the Altar of Incenſe. Now unleſs it was ordered to be cleanſed in theſe words, I can ſee no care taken about it at all. In XXX <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. there is expreſs mention indeed made of <hi>making an atonement</hi> upon the Altar of Incenſe once a year;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52830:146"/>and nothing ſaid of the other: and if we will ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it here, then the words, <hi>he ſhall go out,</hi> muſt have reſpect to <hi>his going into the holy place,</hi> mentioned in the Verſe before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And make an atonement for it.]</hi> This is generally underſtood, as I ſaid, of the golden Altar, becauſe ſuch expreſs mention is made of its Purification yearly, in the place now mentioned, XXX <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. And no doubt, that which is here commanded, was done there, when he made Atonement for the Table, where it ſtood: But there being the ſame need, as I ſaid, to expiate the other Altar (where no fewer Errors had been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than here, and which ſtood nearer to an unclean People, who incompaſſed it) I cannot but think that its here included.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhall take of the blood of the Bullock, and of the Goat.]</hi> He put the Blood of the Bullock and of the goat together; and then poured them into another Veſſel, that they might be well mingled. For here is no command in this place, that he ſhould go round the Altar twice; and tip the Horns of it, firſt with the Blood of the Bullock, and then of the Goat, ſeparate one from the other; as the <hi>Miſna</hi> in <hi>Joma</hi> obſerves, <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhall cleanſe it and hallow it, from the uncleanneſs of the Children of</hi> Iſrael.] The Jews refer this clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to his taking the Coals and the Aſhes from the Altar, that he might ſprinkle the Blood in a clean place. And then the words are to be tranſlated, <hi>He ſhall ſprinkle the blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>having cleanſed and hallowed it.</hi> But the concluſion of the Verſe determines us to another fenſe, which is, That by ſprinkling the Blood he cleanſed and ſanctified it, from <hi>the uncleanneſs of the children of Iſrael,</hi> whereby it had been defiled: the Prieſts having either come in their uncleanneſs thither, or not performed their Service as they ought there; and the People thereby remaining in their Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>Now when the High-Prieſt had done all this, the Jews ſay (in the <hi>Miſna</hi> before-named) he poured the reſt of the Blood of the Bullock and Goat, at the bottom of the Altar of <hi>Burnt-offerings,</hi> (where, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, he concluded this Atonement) for there was a conveyance to carry it away, as I obſerved upon IV. 7. And they make account alſo, that if every thing was not done in this order, it was ineffectual, and was to be done over again. For example; If the Blood of the Goat, was ſprinkled before the Blood of the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock (contrary to the directions <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15.) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and ſprinkled the Blood of the Goat, after that of the Bullock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52830:148"/>them, but whether exactly, or not, cannot be determined. But it is probable that <hi>Sins,</hi> ſignifie Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences committed by Error, not deliberately; <hi>Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> ſuch as were deliberately committed againſt the prohibiting Precepts; and <hi>Tranſgreſſions,</hi> thoſe that were deliberately committed againſt commanding Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.

               <p>
                  <hi>Putting them upon the head of the Goat.]</hi> By putting his hands on the head of the Goat, and confeſſing their Sins over him (with Prayer to God to remit them) they were all charged upon the Goat, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them transferred from the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> unto it. Juſt as the Sins of all Mankind were afterwards laid upon our Saviour Chriſt (as the Prophet ſpeaks, LIII <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.) <hi>who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body,</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Peter</hi> 1. II. 24.) the puniſhment paſſing from us to him, <hi>who was made Sin for us,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> V. 21. Which Expreſſions are manifeſt Alluſions unto this Sacrifice on the great Day of Expiation: which was the moſt illuſtrious Figure of the Sacrifice of Chriſt; and ſhows, beyond all reaſonable contradiction, that Chriſt ſuffered in our ſtead, and not meerly for our benefit. For it is very evident, the Sacrifice offered on this day, was put in the place of the People; and all their Sins, that is, the puniſhment of them, laid upon its head. And it appears by the form of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sin-offerings,</hi> which were occaſionally offered at other times, that he who brought them put off the guilt, which he had contracted, from himſelf, and laid it on the Sacrifice, which was to die for him. Which he did by laying his hand on the head of it at the door of the Tabernacle, while it was yet alive. Then with his hand ſo placed, he made a Confeſſion of his
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52830:149"/>Sins, for which he deſired forgiveneſs by the offering of this Sacrifice: That is, he prayed by theſe Rites, that the Beaſt being offered and ſlain, he might be ſpared from puniſhment; which was a plain transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the guilt from himſelf unto his Sacrifice. Which being yet alive, and thus laded with his guilt, was then brought to the Altar, and there ſlain for the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Perſon: That is, it died in his ſtead; for there was no other reaſon of its being put to death there, and in that manner.</p>
               <p>I have inſiſted the longer on this, becauſe nothing can better explain the true meaning of <hi>Chriſt's dying for us:</hi> which was by transferring the ſuffering due to our Sins, upon him; as the manner was in the Legal Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. Which was a thing, let me add, ſo notorious in the World, that other Nations from hence derived the like cuſtom, to that here mentioned by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Particularly the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as <hi>David Chytraeus</hi> hath long ago obſerved, and ſince him many others out of <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus:</hi> who tells us (<hi>Lib.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 39.) that they made this Execration over the Head of the Beaſt which they ſacrificed; <gap reason="foreign">

And the Nobles of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they add, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him the firſt Mile; further than which they might not go, becauſe this day was a <hi>Sabbath.</hi> After which, they that were in the firſt Tabernacle accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him to the next; and they that were there to the third; and ſo forward to the laſt; that they might be ſure to have this great work done, of carrying their Sins
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:52830:150"/>quite away from them. So we read in the Treatiſe on this Subject, called <hi>Joma, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4, 5. which <hi>Maimonides</hi> hath explained, as I have now done.</p>

                  <hi>And the Goat ſhall bear upon him all their iniquities.]</hi> This ſhows more fully ſtill, the nature of this Sacrifice, in which <hi>all their iniquities, i. e.</hi> the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of them was laid, that he might carry them away. For this Goat was not capable to bear their ſins, but only their puniſhment; as Chriſt alſo did, who <hi>knew no ſin,</hi> and yet was <hi>made ſin;</hi> by having the puniſhment of our ſins laid on him. For that this <hi>Scape-goat,</hi> which was loaded with their ſins, was a <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> is plainly ſaid before in this Chapter; and conſequently repreſented Chriſt (who is our Sin-offering) as well as the other part of this <hi>Sin-offering</hi> did, whoſe Blood was carried into the holy place. And in ſome regard this <hi>Scape-goat</hi> was a very notable repreſentation of him; if it be true, that our Saviour entred upon his Office, of being the Mediator of our reconciliation with God, upon this great Day of Atonement, which was the Day on which he was Baptized, as our Dr. <hi>Jackſon,</hi> together with ſome good Chronologers think. For though the Tradition of the Weſtern Church be, that his Baptiſm was on the Sixth of <hi>January,</hi> yet as <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and ſome others of the Roman Communion, do not think fit to follow it, ſo he judges it more probable to have been on the Tenth of <hi>September.</hi> In the beginning of which Month, when the Feaſt of Blowing of Trumpets was celebrated (as we read XXIII of this Book, 24.) <hi>John Baptist</hi> began to lift up his Voice like a Trumpet, and call the Jews to Repentance. Who accordingly flockt to him, and confeſſing their ſins, were baptized by him in <hi>Jordan;</hi> where our Saviour alſo being baptized on the Tenth day, which was the Day of Atonement, and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:52830:150"/>being declared the Son of God by a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, was <hi>immediately driven by the Spirit into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> as St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us I. 12. Which was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt indication (he thinks) to <hi>John Baptist,</hi> that this was the Redeemer of the World prefigured by the <hi>Scape-goat;</hi> who going into the Wilderneſs on the Day of Atonement, immediately after the People had made Confeſſion of their ſins, gave him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand (who was well acquainted with the meaning of the Legal Rites) that he was ſent by God to take upon himſelf the Sins of the World, and carry them away, by being, in due ſeaſon, offered to God, and ſlain as a Sacrifice to God for them. And this he did at that very time, when the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was killed, (as I have ſhown upon XII <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.) to the end that they might take notice he was the Lamb of God, whoſe Sacrifice that Lamb prefigured: as by being led into the Wilderneſs on the ſame day the Scape-goat was carried thither, he ſhow'd that the Myſtery repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by that Ceremony, was exactly fulfilled in him.</p>
               <p>This Notion of his I thought good to mention (though as far as I know, he is ſingular in it) becauſe it carries ſome probability in it, if what the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 17. be well conſidered, That the Law contained <hi>ſhadows of things to come, the body of which was Christ.</hi> Who was a <hi>Body</hi> conſiſting of ſo many different parts, and ſo compleat (as he obſerves) that no one, nor a few Legal Ceremonies, could perfectly <hi>fore-ſhadow</hi> it: But as the Ceremonies were many, and almoſt infinite; ſo every one did <hi>fore-ſhadow</hi> ſome part or piece of this compleat <hi>Body:</hi> That is, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable part of it, no ſpecial Event or Action, which concerned our Saviour Chriſt, but was fore-ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome or other Legal Ceremony.

                  </gap>, <hi>a Land into which no body came,</hi> or <hi>a deſolate Country.</hi> The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word properly imports <hi>a Land cut off</hi> (as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chart.</hi> obſerves, <hi>Lib.</hi> II. <hi>Hierozoic. cap.</hi> 54. <hi>P.</hi> I.) that is, from habitable Countries: not which <hi>cuts off</hi> what is ſent into it, by its rugged and ſharp ſtones, as the <hi>Jews</hi> expound it. This ſtill ſets out the deſign of this Sacrifice, which was to free Men ſo perfectly from the puniſhment of their ſins, that they ſhould not fear the return of them any more. For this Goat was not meerly ſent into the Wilderneſs, but into the moſt inhabitable and inacceſſible part of it (as the Greek word properly ſignifies) where none were likely ever to ſee it again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſhall let go the Goat in the wilderneſs.]</hi> When he came to the laſt ſtage, no body accompanied him that led the Goat, any further; but he went the <hi>tenth</hi> Mile alone by himſelf; and the Men in the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle only ſtood looking to ſee what he did with it. And the <hi>Miſna</hi> ſaith (in the place before-named) that he threw it headlong down the Rock <hi>Tzuk;</hi> where, they ſay, it was broke in pieces before it came to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of it; or, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſaith, God raiſed a ſtorm which blew the Goat down with a mighty force.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:52830:151"/>But this is contrary to the very words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſaith, he was to <hi>let the Goat go,</hi> or diſmiſs him, <hi>in the Wilderneſs,</hi> to run whither he would. And it ſeems contrary alſo to the intention of this Law, which was that only one of the Goats ſhould be killed, the other let go alive. Whereby was repreſented, that their ſins, which were expiated by the Blood of the Sacrifice, ſhould not return again to be charged upon them. Or, that they were as free from their Sins, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous Perſon was from his Confinement, when the Bird was let fly into the Fields. Which perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the puniſhment of their ſins, was further ſignified by the burning of the Fleſh, the Skin, and the Dung of the <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> without the Camp: which denoted that all memory of the ſins, for which this Expiation was appointed, was clean remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> will have it, that a piece of Scarlet Cloth being tied upon the Horns of this <hi>Scape-goat</hi> (as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other was about the Neck of the Goat which was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed) when the Man had brought it to the top of the Rock <hi>Tzuk,</hi> he divided the Cloth into two pieces, and let the Goat go away with one, but tied the other to the Rock, that he might ſee when it changed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and became white, as they ſay it did when the Goat was thrown down headlong. Anciently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they ſay, this Scarlet Cloth was tied to the Gate of the Temple, and if it turned white when the Goat was ſent away, (as they pretend it uſually did) there was great joy among the People; becauſe it was a ſign their ſins were forgiven, according to that of the Prophet, I <hi>Iſa.</hi> 18. <hi>Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be white as ſnow,</hi> &amp;c. But if it did not change its colour into white, they hung down their heads, and were full of ſorrow; they looking upon it as
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:52830:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>a Token of God's anger. Which I relate only for this purpoſe, that I may take notice how the ſame Authors, who tell this ſtory, confeſs, that for <hi>forty</hi> years before the deſtruction of the ſecond Temple, that is, from the time of our Saviour's death, this ſhred of Cloth never changed its colour at all. Which, if it be true, was a notable Token of the Wrath of God coming upon them, for their crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the LORD Chriſt.</p>

And the Jews call by this name of <hi>golden Garments,</hi> all the eight Garments of the High-Prieſt: four of which were common to him with the lower Prieſts, and were made only of Linen, (yet they never call them by the name of <hi>white Garments,</hi> which they appropriate to thoſe in which he went into the moſt holy place) the other four, which gave the name to all the reſt, were proper only to the High-Prieſt himſelf; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Robe</hi> (which had Bells of Gold at the bottom) the <hi>Ephod,</hi> the <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> and the <hi>Golden-plate</hi> upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: which being put over the other four common Garments, made him appear as if he were all clothed in Gold.

               <p>And the intent of the Apoſtle in this, and other ſuch like Obſervations, was to ſhow, that our Saviour's Sufferings on the Croſs, were a moſt true and proper Sacrifice; a Sacrifice fully ſatisfactory for the Sins of the World: or rather, more ſatisfactory for all the Sins of Men againſt the Moral Law of God, than the

But this is plainly an idle Tale invented by him, or his Followers; for the Jews would rather have feaſted, than faſted upon the day of ſuch a Deliverance. But it ſhows that this Day was remarkable among the Jews, and ſolemnly obſerved by them, whereſoever they were; and was choſen by God, rather than any other Day of the Month, (if we may believe <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides, More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 43.) becauſe it was the day on which <hi>Moſes</hi> came down from the Mount, with the ſecond Tables in his hand, and proclaimed to the People the Remiſſion of their great Sin, in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the golden Calf; in memory of which it was ordered to be intirely a Day of Repentance, and of Divine Worſhip.</p>

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:52830:157"/>Bed; nor read (if their Doctors ſay true) any portion of the Law, which would give them delight: For example, the ſtory of their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and leading them through the Red Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo far is the <hi>Mahometan</hi> ſtory from having any colour of truth. It is likely alſo, that to increaſe their Grief, they rent their Clothes, (as they did in other Faſts in after times) put on Sackcloth, girded it cloſe to their Fleſh, ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Aſhes on their heads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which were all intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no doubt, to work in them an inward ſorrow for all their ſins, with an hearty abhorrence of them, and reſolution to mortifie and abſtain from them.

               <p>The Hebrew Doctors here obſerve, that they did not afflict little Children on this day, by making them faſt from all Food, till they were of the Age of Eleven years: But only taught them what they were to do when they came of Age, that they might be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to the Precept.

For the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> was promiſed them, upon condition that they kept the Law, offering all the Sacrifices therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; eſpecially this great Sacrifice, which was to cleanſe them from the guilt of all their Neglects, or Breaches of this Law. Which ſhould teach us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to conclude, That as the Inheritance of that good Land, was aſſigned the Jews in conſideration of their Sacrifices, as the condition of that Covenant, by which they were preſcribed; ſo the Inheritance of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, is made over to us by the Covenant of Grace, in conſideration of the Obedience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt Jeſus, of which they were a Figure.

But the Day of Expiation freed thoſe, who were bound to offer Sacrifices for <hi>dubious</hi> Offences. So <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſaith (in his Treatiſe of <hi>Offences committed through Error,</hi> cap. 3. ſect. 9.) that thoſe ſins which were known to none but God, were taken away by this ſolemn Day of Expiation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Sacrifice. But the <hi>Miſna</hi> in the laſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Joma,</hi> acknowledges very honeſtly, that the Day of Expiation did not purge Men from the guilt of the Offences they had committed againſt their Neighbour, unleſs they firſt gave him Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                  <hi>Before the LORD.]</hi> Who dwelt among them, and would continue to do ſo, if they obſerved his Laws, and took care to be thus cleanſed from all their ſins. But leaſt any Man ſhould miſtake this matter, it may be here fit to obſerve, that there were no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices at all appointed by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> for Capital Offences; and therefore when he ſpeaks here of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them clean from <hi>all their ſins</hi> upon this day, ſuch as theſe (for inſtance, <hi>Murder, Adultery, Idolatry,</hi> &amp;c.) are not included: for this great Sacrifice could not obtain a Pardon for them, but only for Offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the Ritual Laws contained in this Book, and that alſo when they were committed through Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror or Ignorance: for if they were done preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, <hi>cutting off</hi> was threatned to them. See XV <hi>Numb.</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 22. to <hi>v.</hi> 32. And this appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Sacrifices themſelves that are here appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which had no vertue in them from their own worth and value, but only from God's Inſtitution, to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:52830:158"/>make Expiation for any Sin. For the death of a Bullock or a Goat, was not of ſuch account with God, that it could prevail for the taking away of guilt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had given it ſuch a power. And that power which he was pleaſed to allow unto them, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infinite, nor could it be ſo. For the guilt that they were principally deſigned to aboliſh, was not of ſuch a nature as to require ſuch an Expiation: It ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from things which were neither good nor evil in themſelves; and therefore could not create ſuch a guilt. Such were all the uncleanneſſes from certain natural Fluxes, from touching a dead Body, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable other ſuch like Impurities: which depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly upon the will of God, who by a poſitive Law made ſuch things to bring Men under a guilt; by the ſame Will he appointed a proportionable Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by theſe Sacrifices, whoſe power to cleanſe depended alſo purely upon his pleaſure. And if they had any vertue to purge Men from the real guilt of ſins committed againſt the Eternal Laws of God; this they had not of themſelves, but from the moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Will of God, who was pleaſed to apply to this purpoſe, the future Satisfaction of the immaculate Lamb of God, of which theſe Sacrifices were a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and Type. For a Body being prepared for the Son of God, and he offering himſelf for us, that was a Sacrifice of ſuch infinite value in its own nature, that it expiated all manner of ſins of all Men.

               <p>
                  <hi>And offer them for peace-offerings unto the LORD.]</hi> Upon theſe words <hi>Nachmanides</hi> grounds the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named opinion, That whilſt the Jews continued in the Wilderneſs, they ate no Meat at their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Tables, but what had been firſt offered to God at the Tabernacle. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God commanded that all which the Iſraelites did eat, ſhould be Peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> Which was afterwards altered, when they came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and lived remote from the Houſe of God. And ſuch a Cuſtom prevailed among the Gentiles,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:52830:163"/>who would not ſit down to eat at their Tables, till they had offered Bread and Wine unto their Gods. Thus it was among the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> as appears from I <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> 8. But then they had many Altars every where, even in their own private Houſes. Whereas here in the Wilderneſs, there was but one Altar; which could not contain all the Fat that was to be burnt on it eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, if we ſuppoſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to have commonly killed Beaſts for their own eating. It ſeems to be the truer opinion that they ſeldom or never did that, while they were in the Wilderneſs; but all the Beaſts they killed were for Sacrifice, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſpeaks. So <hi>R. Levi Barcelonita</hi> (<hi>Praecept.</hi> CLXXXVII.) and other Jewiſh Doctors, they are here forbidden <hi>to offer a Sacrifice to God any where, without the Tabernacle.</hi> He mentions indeed only <hi>Peace-offerings;</hi> but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe they were moſt common; being offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only for all the Mercies they had received, but for all they deſired to obtain from God; as <hi>Abarbanel</hi> obſerves upon the VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this Book, where the ſeveral ſorts of them are mentioned.

It is ſaid indeed in this place, that they ſhould not eat <hi>any manner of Blood;</hi> but the meaning ſeems to be, neither of Blood offered at the Altar; nor of Beaſts killed for their own uſe: Or elſe it is to be limited as before, to the Blood of Beaſts and Birds, (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) for Fiſhes were not at all conſidered.

For it would have been very unſeemly, if they had vulgarly uſed that, to which they owed the favour of God, and their very Lives.</p>
               <p>Nothing could be more rational than this Precept, <hi>viz.</hi> That a thing ſo ſacred, as to be peculiarly <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them upon the Altar,</hi> ſhould not loſe that honour and eſteem that was due to it. As the Blood would have done, if it had been allowed to be commonly eaten; for that is very contemptible which goes into the Draught, (as our Saviour ſpeaks) and at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Ordure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the ſoul.]</hi> The Blood, that is, of the Sacrifices, which by God's appointment are offered to expiate your ſins; that is, to preſerve you from periſhing. For to <hi>make an Atonement,</hi> and to be a <hi>Ranſom,</hi> are the very ſame thing; as appears from XXX <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. And to be a <hi>Ranſom,</hi> is to deliver from Death, as appears from the words in that place, they ſhall every Man give a Ranſom for his Soul, unto
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:52830:166"/>the LORD, <hi>that there be no Plague among them.</hi> For the ſins of the Sacrificer being laid upon the Beaſt which he offered, by impoſition of his hand on its Head, and confeſſing them there, they were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Blood of that Beaſt, unto which they were tranſlated. And that not meerly by the Obedience of him that offered the Sacrifice, (which the followers of <hi>Socinus</hi> ſay, God accepted) but by the Blood of the Sacrifice it ſelf, as theſe words expreſly declare, which was offered in his ſtead. Thus <hi>Theodoret</hi> upon theſe words; <hi>God commanded the Soul of the Irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with its Blood,</hi>

                  <hi>Neither ſhalt thou take a wife to her ſiſter.]</hi> There are a great many eminent Writers, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing our Marginal Tranſlation, <hi>[one wife to another]</hi> imagine that here plurality of Wives is expreſly forbidden by God? And they think there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to juſtifie this Tranſlation in XXVI <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. Where <hi>Moſes</hi> is commanded to take care the five Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Tabernacle were coupled together <hi>one to its ſiſter</hi> (as the Hebrew phraſe is) <hi>i. e. one to another.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Karaites</hi> interpret this place, That a Man, having a Wife, ſhould not take another while ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Which, if it were true, would ſolve ſeveral difficulties: but there are ſuch ſtrong Reaſons againſt it, that I cannot think it to be the meaning. For as more Wives than one were indulged before the Law, ſo they were after. And <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ſuppoſes as much, when he provides a Man ſhould not prefer a Child he had by a beloved Wife, before one by her whom he hated, if he was the eldeſt Son. Which plainly intimates an allowance in his Law, of more Wives than one. And ſo we find expreſly their Kings might have, though not a multitude, XVII <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. And their beſt King, who read God's Law day and night, and could not but underſtand it, took many
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:52830:176"/>Wives, without any reproof: Nay, God gave him more than he had before, by delivering his Maſter's Wives to him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XII. 8. And beſides all this, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking all along in this Chapter of Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, it is reaſonable (as <hi>Schindlerus</hi> obſerves) to conclude he doth ſo here: not of <hi>one Woman to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> but of <hi>one Siſter to another.</hi> There being alſo the like reaſon to underſtand the word <hi>Siſter</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this place, as the words <hi>Daughter</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> in others, <hi>v.</hi> 17. and XX. 14. where he forbids a Man to take a <hi>Woman and her Daughter,</hi> or a <hi>Woman and her Mother,</hi> as <hi>Theodorick Hackſpan</hi> judiciouſly notes, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſput.</hi> I. <hi>de locutionibus ſacris, n.</hi> 29. See <hi>Selden, L.</hi> V. <hi>de Jure Nat. &amp; Gent. cap.</hi> 6. and <hi>Buxtorf. de Sponſal. p.</hi> 28, 29.</p>
               <p>The meaning therefore is, That though two Wives at a time, or more, were permitted in thoſe days, no Man ſhould take two Siſters (as <hi>Jacob</hi> had formerly done) begotten of the ſame Father, or born of the ſame Mother, whether legitimately or illegitimately, as the fore-named <hi>R. Levi</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Praecept.</hi> CCVI. Which though it may ſeem to be prohibited before, by conſequence and analogy (becauſe the Marriage of a Brother's Wife is forbidden <hi>v.</hi> 16.) yet it is here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly prohibited, as other Marriages are; which were implicitly forbidden before. For <hi>v.</hi> 7. the Marriage of a Son with his Mother is forbidden: and <hi>v.</hi> 10. the Marriage of a Father with his Daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To vex her.]</hi> There were wont to be great Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Jealouſies, and contentions between Wives (ſome of them being more beloved than others, and alſo ſuperiour to them) which between two Siſters would have been more intolerable, than between two other Women: who not being <hi>à conſanguinitate, aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore animo ſub eodem marito, aetatem unà agant</hi> (as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:52830:176"/>Cunaeus</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Lib.</hi> II. <hi>de Repub. Hebr. cap.</hi> 23.) of the ſame Conſanguinity (as two Siſters are) might live with more equal and quiet minds under the ſame Husband. The Vulgar Latin underſtands this, as if <hi>Moſes</hi> forbad them to make one Siſter their <hi>Wife,</hi> and the other their <hi>Concubine;</hi> which could not but beget the greateſt diſcords between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In her life time.]</hi> From hence, ſome infer that a Man was permitted to marry the Siſter of his former Wife, when ſhe was dead. So the <hi>Talmudiſts;</hi> but the <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raites</hi> thought it abſolutely unlawful, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves, <hi>Lib.</hi> I. <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xore Hebr. cap.</hi> 4. For it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the Scope of all theſe Laws, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit Men to marry at all with ſuch Perſons as are here mentioned, either in their Wives life time, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And there being a Prohibition <hi>v.</hi> 16. to marry a Brother's Wife, it is unreaſonable to think <hi>Moſes</hi> gave them leave to marry their Wive's Siſter. Theſe words therefore, <hi>In her life time,</hi> are to be referred, not to the firſt words, <hi>Neither ſhalt thou take her,</hi> but to the next, <hi>To vex her,</hi> as long as ſhe lives. <hi>Chaskuni</hi> refers it to both the Siſters, according to the <hi>Targum.</hi> and makes this the ſenſe; <hi>least they ſhould both be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Widows as long as they live:</hi> for no Body would marry either of them, being defiled by ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Conjunction, for which God cut off their Husband.</p>
               <p>In this the ancient Chriſtians were ſo ſtrict, that if a Man, after his Wife died, married her Siſter, he was by the <hi>tenth</hi> Canon of the Council of <hi>Eliberis,</hi> to be kept from the Communion five years.</p>

Lib.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.) as the Queen of Heaven was the <hi>Moon,</hi> VII <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. Now
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:52830:177"/>it is evident by ſeveral paſſages in Scripture, that the ancient Pagans (whom the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were prone to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate) not only made their Children <hi>paſs through the fire;</hi> but alſo <hi>offered</hi> them in Sacrifice unto <hi>Molech.</hi> The former I take to be forbidden in this Law; the latter in XX. 3. where giving their Children to <hi>Molech</hi> is prohibited under a ſevere Penalty, of being put to death for that Crime: whereas there is no Penalty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed here to their making them <hi>paſs through the fire.</hi> Which I take therefore to have been a leſs Crime than the other; though an idolatrous Rite practiſed by thoſe, who abhorred the cruelty of offering the very Life of their dear Children to <hi>Molech.</hi> Inſtead of which this Rite was deviſed, of making them paſs through the fire (for though the word <hi>fire</hi> be not here in the Hebrew Text, yet it is underſtood by all, and expreſſed XVIII <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.) by way of Purification, and <hi>Luſtration,</hi> as they called it; and by this means to dedicate them to the Worſhip and Service of <hi>Molech.</hi> And therefore, being a Rite of Initiation, whereby Parents conſecrated their Sons and Daughters to their Deities; we never find it mentioned in Scripture, but only concerning Children (not concerning Men and Women) whom the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are forbidden to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in this manner; which was in truth, to alienate them from the LORD God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that this was practiſed among the ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans as a Rite of Initiation, appears particularly in the Myſteries of <hi>Mithra,</hi> (See <hi>Suidas</hi> upon that word) and continued long among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> if we may believe <hi>Benjamin Tudelenſis,</hi> in his <hi>Itinearium, p.</hi> 214. See <hi>G.

And ſo this Hebrew Phraſe is uſed XIII <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. and may very well be thus underſtood here, for devoting, or making over their Children unto <hi>Molech.</hi> For the Heathen thought their Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and obnoxious to the Anger of their Gods, and conſequently in danger to be taken away from them, if they were not thus expiated, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells us, <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 37. And on the contrary, they fancied (as <hi>R. Levi Barcelonita</hi> obſerves, <hi>Praecept.</hi> CCVIII.) that if only one of their Children were thus conſecrated to <hi>Molech,</hi> all the reſt were bleſſed, and ſhould be proſperous. For he very <hi>nicely</hi> takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are forbidden to make <hi>any of their ſeed</hi> to paſs through the fire: It not being the manner, he ſaith, to make them all paſs. But the idolatrous Prieſts (to make the People more willing to this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) cunningly perſwaded them, that if any one Child was offered to <hi>Molech,</hi> it procured a Bleſſing upon all; and if there was only one Child in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, they laid no Obligation on the Parents to do this.</p>
               <p>The manner of doing it, at this diſtance of time, cannot certainly be known. Some ſay their Parents carried them through two fires upon their ſhoulders. Others, that they were led between them by their Prieſts: and ſo <hi>R. Levi</hi> in the place before-named; <hi>The Father delivered the Child to the Prieſt, in the name of the Idol; just as it is ſaid concerning Legal Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> (XV. 14.) <hi>he ſhall give them to the Priest.</hi> Others think that the Prieſt, or ſome Body elſe, waved the Child about in the very flame, while Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men danced round the fire; nay, leaped through the flame. And <hi>Joh. Coch</hi> obſerves, upon the Title <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim, cap.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 7. that ſome are of the opinion, the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:52830:178"/>Children thus dedicated, did not walk, but dance through the fire: which being an emblem and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the Sun, plainly ſignified ſuch Children were conſecrated to that Deity. And this comes nearer to the Hebrew phraſe, as we tranſlate it, that they did not paſs <hi>between fires,</hi> but <hi>through the fire.</hi> But which way ſoever it was done, whether they waved the Child through the very fire, and preſented it to <hi>Molech,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom the fire was kindled, or led it between two fires; when they had ſo done, the Prieſt reſtored the Child to the Father again. And in ſome ſuch way <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi> made his Son <hi>to paſs through the fire, according to the abomination of the Heathen,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> XVI. 3. which cannot be meant of his burning him: for <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his Son outlived him, and ſucceeded in his Throne.

               <p>
                  <hi>Neither lie one to another.]</hi> Words being intended to declare the Mind, and for no other end; he that hears us ſpeak hath a right in Juſtice to be done him, that what we ſpeak be true. For otherwiſe he doth not know our mind by our words; and then we had better be dumb. But though all kind of lying be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the intention of God, in giving us Speech; yet this relates particularly to ſuch lies whereby a Man's Neighbour was injured; defrauded, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of his Goods which he had depoſited with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; or of the juſt Debts which were owing him,

So the Jewiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors interpret it, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves in the ſame place. If any Man did, and was found guilty, he was adjudged to reſtore the principal, and a fifth part more, VI. 5. And whether he forſwore himſelf know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, or ignorantly, he was to expiate his Crime with a Sacrifice. But if he was ignorant of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand concerning a Sacrifice; or if, though he had the thing which he denied in his keeping, yet he had really forgot it, when he ſwore he had it not; he was freed both from the <hi>fifth</hi> part, and from the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> See V. 4.</p>

As if a Man ſwore in his anger he would not ſpeak to ſuch a Perſon, but afterwards did; or, he would not eat of ſuch Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In ſuch caſes, the Jews ſay, when a Man's heart was touched with Repentance for his raſhneſs and incogitancy; he was to go to ſome wiſe Man, or to <hi>three</hi> Neighbours, and deſire them to abſolve him from his Oath, of which he truly repented. Which they did, when they found him truly penitent; ſaying, <hi>Be thou looſed,</hi> or, <hi>It is remitted to thee,</hi> or the like.

                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him,</hi> &amp;c. Here are ſeveral Precepts, almoſt coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident in their ſenſe: but have ſome peculiar Negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to them. For (as <hi>R. Levi Barcelonita</hi> obſerves) <hi>in all things from which God would have them carefully abſtain, he multiplies admonitions, Praecept.</hi> CXXXVI. Accordingly here to <hi>defraud,</hi> is to keep in ones hand that which belongs to another: and ſuch a Perſon, he ſaith, is called an <hi>Oppreſſor</hi> in Scripture. The <hi>Vulgar Latine</hi> refers it to that which Men get from others by <hi>Calumny:</hi> as the next words relate to that which is wreſted from them by open violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither rob him.]</hi> The ſame <hi>R. Levi</hi> expounds this of that which is taken from another by manifeſt force, and doth not belong to him that takes it, <hi>Praecept.</hi> CCXXXVII. For ſo the Hebrew word <hi>gazilah</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that which a Man wreſts out of the hand of another, againſt his will, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XI. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The wages of him that is hired, ſhall not abide with thee all night till the morning.]</hi> For this was a kind of force and robbery, to detain what was owing to him, againſt his will. In the XXIV <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. the words are, <hi>Thou ſhalt give him his hire, neither ſhall the Sun go down upon it.</hi> From whence the Hebrew Doctors conclude there were two ſorts of People that wrought for hire: one were <hi>day-labourers,</hi> whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of in this Verſe; another <hi>labourers by night,</hi> of whom he ſpeaks in <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> Neither of which were to ſtay for
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:52830:185"/>their Wages beyond the time appointed: but the one were to have it before the Sun-ſet, the other before Morning; for it was due as ſoon as the day, or the night was done. So the <hi>Miſna, The Day-labourer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires his wages all night; and the night Labourer all day.</hi> See the fore-named <hi>R. Levi, Praecept.</hi> CCXXXVIII. who gives this reaſon for it; That <hi>the merciful God would have his Creatures ſubſiſt; which poor Labourers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, if they want their wages to buy them Victuals.</hi> Upon which account the detaining of their Wages, is ſaid to be <hi>a crying ſin,</hi> in that XXIV <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. and in St. <hi>James</hi> V. 4.</p>

                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not curſe the deaf.]</hi> No <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> whether Man or Woman, was to be curſed; though he could not hear the Curſe, and ſo was inſenſible of the Injury, as <hi>R. Levi</hi> explains it, <hi>Praecept.</hi> CCXXXIX. For there was the addition of barbarous baſeneſs in it, to curſe or revile a Perſon, who was not capable to anſwer for himſelf, nor do himſelf right: and the Caſe of the Sick, and the Infirm, or the Abſent, was the ſame with the Deaf. As for others, who were not Deaf, it was forbidden to curſe them, ſaith <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> becauſe it provoked to Anger and Rage; which ſtirred Men up to take Revenge.</p>
               <p>

And therefore expound it of giving ill Counſel to ſimple People, and adviſing them to their Damage. So <hi>R. Levi, Praecept.</hi> CCXL. which is no leſs contrary to Nature, then laying a ſtumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block in the way of thoſe that cannot ſee to avoid it; and a far greater ſin, becauſe it abuſed their Minds, and might tend to the hurt of their Souls.</p>

                  <hi>Ye ſhall do no unrighteouſneſs in judgment.]</hi> The Jews take this to be an Admonition to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that they ſhould have an equal regard to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff and Defendant; and not prefer the one before the other. Whence theſe words are thus explained in <hi>Siphra, Thou ſhalt judge thy neighbours juſtly; not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one party ſtand, and bidding the other ſit; nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering one to ſpeak as much as he pleaſeth, and bidding the other be ſhort.</hi> See <hi>Selden de Synedr. Lib.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>n.</hi> 10. But none hath explained this ſo largely as <hi>Maimonides</hi> in the whole XXI Chapter of <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> where he in general defines the juſt Adminiſtration of Juſtice to conſiſt in an equal reſpect to both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Suit; ſo that one of them have not the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſay what he will, and the other be cut ſhort. And then deſcends to many particulars, wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual reſpect to both Parties is to be obſerved: ſome of which it will be fit to mention, becauſe they illuſtrate the words of St <hi>James,</hi> in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Chapter of his Epiſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4. <hi>If two Parties appear in a Cauſe, one of which is clothed in precious Garments, the other is ragged, or in a poor Habit; let it be ſaid to him that is the more honourable, Either do you beſtow upon your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary as good Apparel as you have on your ſelf, or elſe put on ſuch as he wears, that you may be both alike, and then appear before the Court of Judgment. By no means let the one ſit, and the other ſtand: but let them both be commanded to ſtand: or if it pleaſe the Judges to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:52830:186"/>give them both leave to ſit, let not one of them ſit in a high place, the other in a low; but both on the ſame Bench, one by the ſide of the other.</hi> See <hi>R. Levi Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonita, Praecept.</hi> CCXVII. who obſerves, that Mankind are preſerved by righteous Judgment; and therefore if a Judge was found to have given an unjuſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he was condemned to make Reſtitution to him, whoſe Cauſe he had perverted, <hi>Praecept.</hi> CCXLI.</p>

                  <hi>Nor honour the perſon of the mighty.]</hi> This <hi>R. Levi</hi> explains (<hi>Praecept.</hi> CCXLII.) as he did the firſt Clauſe; <hi>The Judge ſhall not bid the great man ſit down, while the meaner ſtands; but both ſhall ſtand before the Judge, as if they were in the Preſence of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who ſtandeth in the midſt of the Judges,</hi> LXXXII <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. If by the favour of the Judges both were permitted to ſit, yet when Sentence came to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, both roſe up and ſtood; according to XVIII <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in righteouſneſs ſhalt thou judge thy neighbour.]</hi> The obſervation of <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſeems to be too nice and curious, who from this place gathers, that though the loweſt Court of Judgment ordinarily conſiſted of no leſs than <hi>three</hi> Judges; yet by the Law one of them might ſit alone as Judge in Matters not Capital, becauſe it is ſaid here in the ſingular Number, <hi>In righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhalt thou judge thy Neighbour.</hi> For at the ſame time he acknowledges, their wiſe Men require that he ſhould take ſome Aſſeſſors to him; when they ſay, <hi>Do not judge by thy ſelf alone; for there is no ſole Judge, but one only,</hi> viz. <hi>God.</hi> See <hi>Selden, Lib.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>n.</hi> 2. and <hi>Guil.

For commonly ſuch Men carry falſe ſtories to their Neighbours, or add to the true, and ſecretly backbite others; which hath moved many to think a <hi>Detractor</hi> is meant by this word, who hopes by his Tales of others to get ſome advantage to himſelf, as every Trader doth by his Merchandiſe. Whence the Jews ſay, <hi>An evil Tongue kills three: him that ſpeaks; him that hears; and him of whom he ſpeaks,</hi> R. Levi Praecept. CCXLIII.</p>

So it is commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, becauſe the Accuſers and Witneſſes ſtood before Judges, who ſat in the Courts of Judgment. But <hi>R. Levi Barcelonita,</hi> and the reſt of the Hebrew Doctors, generally underſtand it otherwiſe; that no Man ſhould ſuffer his Neighbour to periſh in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or other ways, when he could free him by his Teſtimony or Aſſiſtance, <hi>Praecept.</hi> CCXLIV. So it is ſaid in <hi>Siphra</hi> in ſo many words; <hi>Whence do we gather that he who can clear another by his Teſtimony, muſt not ſuppreſs it in ſilence? Becauſe it is ſaid thou ſhalt not ſtand againſt the blood of thy Neighbour.</hi> Whence it follows, that if a Man ſaw his Neighbour any way
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:52830:187"/>in danger, he was bound, if he could, to deliver him; not only when his Life was in hazard, but that which is as dear as Life, ones Honour and Chaſtity. Thus if any one went about to force a Woman, eſpouſed to another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he that ſaw it was bound to Reſcue ſuch a Perſon, though with the death of him that made the Attempt.

               <p>The reaſon the Jews commonly give for this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, is, becauſe God having made all things perfect in their kind, it was a preſumptuous attempt to go about to mend his Creation, and add to his Works.

See our learned Dr. <hi>Spencer, Lib.</hi> II. <hi>de Leg. Hebr.

Levi</hi> extends it to Trees; which, he ſaith, they were not to ingraft of different kinds, one upon another. But it concerns, they ſay, only ſuch Seeds and Plants as are for Mens food; not thoſe which are for Medecine, <hi>Praecept.</hi> CCL. But <hi>Maimonides</hi> found a particular reaſon for this Precept, from the Idolatrous Cuſtoms of the old <hi>Zabij:</hi> Who not only ſowed different Seeds, and grafted Trees of a divers kind upon one another, in ſuch or ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Planets, and with a certain form of words, and fumigations; but alſo with abominable filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at the very moment of the Inciſion.

The Jews have taken abundance of pains to find out the original of this word; which <hi>Bochartus</hi> derives from the Arabick word <hi>Saat,</hi> which ſignifies to mingle, and <hi>nez,</hi> which ſignifies to weave. <hi>Hierozoicon P.</hi> I. <hi>Lib.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 45.

And the reaſons for this abhorrence, are commonly ſuch as are given of the former Precepts; to preſerve them from the horrid Confuſion which was among the Gentiles, by inceſtuous and unnatural Mixtures. But <hi>Maimonides</hi> takes it to have been principally intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a Preſervative againſt Idolatry: The Prieſts of the Gentiles in thoſe times wearing ſuch mixed Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the product of Plants and Animals, with a Ring on their finger, made of ſome Metal, as he ſays, he found in their Books, <hi>More Nevoch.

                  <hi>Whoſoever lieth carnally with a Woman that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband.]</hi> The Jews had ſome Servants that were Gentiles; who, if they embraced the Jewiſh Religion, were baptized; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with the reſervation of their Servitude, and ſometimes with the full grant of Liberty.

For young Trees grow better, if they be ſtript of their Fruit; the Juice of which is wateriſh and unconcocted, having neither pleaſant ſmell nor taſte; as <hi>Nachmonides</hi> obſerves: and therefore not fit for Food; and upon that ſcore not fit to be offered as the Firſt-fruits to God.</p>

               <p>But beſides all this, <hi>Maimonides</hi> affirms there was an Idolatrous cuſtom among the <hi>Zabij,</hi> to which this Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> may reaſonably be thought to be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: For they imagined all Trees would be blaſted, or their Fruit fall off, whoſe Firſt-fruit was not part of it offered in their Idol Temples, and the other part eaten there: as their Children, they thought, would not thrive, unleſs ſome of them paſſed through the fire. And therefore God commanded his People to forbear to eat the Fruit of any Tree, till the <hi>fourth</hi> year; and not doubt of the fruitfulneſs of their Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, though they did not Conſecrate the Fruit of the years foregoing, after the manner that the Gentiles did. <hi>More Nevoch.

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:52830:193"/>Worſhippers did upon the fleſh) they contracted a Friendſhip and Familiarity with them.

For the Jews ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally think ſomething of this nature is here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; the Hebrew word <hi>teonenu</hi> being derived, they imagine, from <hi>Onah,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>time</hi> (as <hi>R.

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:52830:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>that word in the Hebrew Language, they rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive <hi>teonenu</hi> from <hi>Anan,</hi> a <hi>Cloud;</hi> imagining <hi>Moſes</hi> to forbid them to mark the flying of the Clouds; or to make obſervations from their Motions; which was a thing common among the Gentiles. But <hi>Maimonides,</hi> who in the XI Chapter of <hi>Avoda Zara</hi> interprets it, as we do, of <hi>obſerving times,</hi> by eſteeming one day fortunate, and another unfortunate; mentions ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notion of this word from <hi>ain,</hi> an <hi>eye:</hi> and ſaith in the ſame Treatiſe, that Juglers, who delude Mens ſight, in playing their tricks, are comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of <hi>Meonim.</hi> And there are thoſe alſo, who deriving this word from <hi>ana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I ſhall not determine which of theſe is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but only obſerve, that there was no Superſtition of this ſort more ancient than that of <hi>Aſtrology:</hi> which was in uſe among the old <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> who pretended to caſt Mens Nativities (as we ſpeak) and thence to tell their Fortunes.

But then this Caution was moſt neceſſary, when they were going Captives into that Country; which at that time was undoubtedly infected with this Error, but may be thought, perhaps, not to have been ſo in the days of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and therefore I ſay no more of it, but this, That

And ſo <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> underſtands it: though there be no footſteps, that I can find of this, in any other Author; but it is probable only, from what goes before. There is far greater reaſon for another Expoſition, that theſe <hi>Prints</hi> were made in the Fleſh, that they who had them might be known to belong to ſuch or ſuch a God. For it was the cuſtom of Idolaters, ſaith the often-named <hi>R.

               <p>It is poſſible there might be ſome Nations then that made ſome Marks in their Fleſh, as an Ornament to them: for at this day the Women in <hi>Greenland</hi> do not paint their Faces, which are very ſwarthy, but ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize them in ſeveral places, by drawing a Needle and Thread, dipt in Whales greaſe, through the Skin, in what figure they pleaſe.

                  <hi>And reverence my Sanctuary.]</hi> This Reverence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted principally, in coming to it ſo prepared as the Law required; in ſuch Purity and Cleanneſs as was there preſcribed; and then behaving themſelves there with an awful Humility. But the better to ſecure this Reverence, the Maſters in <hi>Iſrael</hi> ordained, that no Man ſhould come into the <hi>Mountain of the Houſe,</hi> with a Staff, or a Sword, or a Girdle with a Purſe, or with Shoes on his feet: and that no Man ſhould ſpit there, nor make it a thorow-fare; nor go out of it with his back towards the Sanctuary; but go backward leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his face towards it, till he was out of the Gate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Maimonides</hi> in his <hi>Beth Habechira, cap.</hi> 7. <hi>R.

               <p>But the great thing which ſecured the Reverence due to the Sanctuary, was, that which I mentioned at firſt, the ſtrict Purity from all Legal Defilements, with which they were to be prepared: which made it very difficult to be in a condition to approach it. For when there were ſo many ways of being defiled, and ſo much time required to make Men clean again, and ſo many things, in many Caſes, to be done for that purpoſe, it
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:52830:198"/>was not poſſible that they ſhould be fit to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very often, without exceeding great care and diligence: as I obſerved before out of the ſame <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides, P.</hi> III. <hi>More Nevoch. cap.</hi> 47. Which very much tended to preſerve their Reverence to the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary. For Men led by ſenſe, as they were, make nothing of thoſe places to which they may go when they pleaſe: but thoſe to which they cannot be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without much Solemnity, and only at certain times, and after great pains to fit themſelves for it, they are apt to have in great eſteem.</p>

For ſo <hi>Maimonides</hi> explains it, in the place now named; <hi>The Sanctuary it ſelf was not to be reverenced, but he who commanded that reverence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor did this Reverence belong only to the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle</hi> or <hi>Temple,</hi> inſtituted by God's expreſs Command; for that Ceremonial Service, which was unlawful to be performed any where elſe (for then it might ſeem proper only to that Ceremonial Diſpenſation, and to be now vaniſht under the Goſpel) but the perpetual practice of the Jewiſh Nation ſhows, that they thought themſelves obliged by this Precept to uſe Reverence in their <hi>Synagogues.</hi> Which were neither inſtituted by any written Precept of the Law, nor for any Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Service, which was confined to the <hi>Temple:</hi> but for publick Aſſemblies, to hear the Law read and expounded; and to offer the Prayers of the People to God. For in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>Aſaph</hi> (where there is the only mention we find of <hi>Synagogues</hi> in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament) they are called, not only <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi> of God, but alſo <hi>Sanctuaries</hi> (as the word is here in <hi>Moſes</hi>) LXXIII <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.

               <p>This Argument indeed became ſtronger, when any Perſons were incorporated with them, and become more one with them than they were with the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> but was of great force to procure kindneſs to thoſe who did not live by their Laws.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſoever he be of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>or of the ſtranger that ſojourneth among you.]</hi> The Proſelytes, who had embraced their Religion, were no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Law, than the Native <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> See XVII. 8, 10, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That giveth any of his ſeed unto</hi> Molech.] This looks like the Prohibition before given XVIII. 21. and <hi>R. Levi</hi> gives this reaſon of its repitition, becauſe it was a piece of Idolatrous Worſhip ſo uſual in thoſe days, when the Law was delivered, that there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great indeavours to preſerve them from it, <hi>Praecept.</hi> CCVIII. And <hi>Maimonides</hi> alſo obſerves (as I noted upon XVIII. 21.) that Idolaters uſed to fright Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into this Worſhip, by telling them their Children would dye, if they did not make them paſs through the fire, and thereby devote them to their Gods. But upon due conſideration of theſe words, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:52830:204"/>probable that there is ſomething more in them than in the former; importing a higher degree of this ſin. For to <hi>give their Children to</hi> Molech, ſeems to be no leſs than to offer them in Sacrifices, (So Chriſt <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf for us</hi> conſtantly ſignifies in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament) which was a more horrid thing, than meerly making them <hi>paſs through the fire,</hi> which did them no hurt. And therefore this Crime is here forbidden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Penalty of Death; whereas in the XVIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter no puniſhment is threatned. Certain it is, Children were really burnt upon the Altars of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Pagans, eſpecially in times of great Diſtreſs, when they hoped to paciſie the Anger of their Gods, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to them the deareſt thing they had. See our great <hi>Selden Lib. de Diis Syris Syntagm</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. where he ſhows the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> offered their Children to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> (ſo <hi>Porphyrius</hi> expreſly ſays, <hi>Lib.</hi> II. <hi>de Abſtin.</hi>) who is ſaid by the Poets to have devoured his own Children; and by many is thought to be the ſame with <hi>Molech.</hi> Though others take it for the <hi>Sun,</hi> to whom it is certain Human Sacrifices were offered. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Authors make mention of it; and <hi>Eben Batrich</hi> thinks ſuch Sacrifices began in the days of <hi>Serug,</hi> and were firſt uſed among the <hi>Syrians.</hi> Which is a very probable Opinion, as <hi>Johan. Geuſius</hi> hath demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Lib. de Victimis Humanis, Pars</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 4, 5. And it is eaſie to conceive how, from the <hi>Syrians,</hi> this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable practice was derived to the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> who worſhipped the <hi>Sun,</hi> under the name of <hi>Baal,</hi> or <hi>Bel,</hi> as <hi>Herodian, Lib.</hi> VIII. teſtifies.

<pb n="396" facs="tcp:52830:205"/>Human Sacrifices, was propagated to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi> and other People of <hi>Africa,</hi> among whom this impious Idolatry continued till the time of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> as <hi>Bochartus</hi> gathers out of <hi>Silius Italicus, Lib.</hi> IV.

               <p>The manner of Sacrificing their Children, and the figure of the Idol to which they offered, is deſcribed by many, according to the Jewiſh Notion; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi> out of <hi>Jalkut:</hi> who makes it an hallow Image, having <hi>ſeven</hi> Apartments in it (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number, I ſuppoſe, of the ſeven Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets) into one of which, <hi>viz.</hi> the loweſt, the Infant was thrown when it was red hot, as Flour, a Turtle Dove, a Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were into the reſt.

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:52830:206"/>(XIX. 30.) that it ſhould be lookt upon as the only place, where acceptable Sacrifices could be offered to him.

On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not ſaid here, what kind of Death they ſhould ſuffer: nor was the ſame kind of Death inflicted upon all that were guilty of this Crime. For if the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Prieſt play'd the Adultereſs, ſhe was to be burnt, XXI. 9. and the Adulterer to be ſtrangled, as the Jews underſtand it. If a man lay with a Virgin eſpouſed to another man, but not yet married, they were both to be ſtoned, by the expreſs words of the Law, XXII <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. But Adultery with a married Woman, if we may credit the Jewiſh Doctors, was puniſhed with ſtrangling. See <hi>Selden, Lib.</hi> III. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor. Hebr. cap.</hi> 2.

This I obſerved before; and ſhall add now, that <hi>ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> as they deſcribe it, was not ſuch a puniſhment as our <hi>hanging men by the neck:</hi> but the Criminal, being ſtuck up to the knees in dung, they tied a Napkin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Neck, and drawing it hard at both ends, choaked him. There was ſuch a thing as <hi>hanging</hi> men on a Gallows, (as we ſpeak) but it was after they were dead, and only ſuch as had been ſtoned: and not all them neither; but ſuch alone as had been ſtoned for Blaſphemy, or Adultery.

               <p>The greateſt thing that can be objected againſt this account of the puniſhment of Adultery, is that which St. <hi>John</hi> tells us the Jews ſaid concerning the Woman taken in the very act of it, <hi>Moſes in the Law command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, that ſuch ſhould be ſtoned,</hi> VIII <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. But it may be anſwered, that this Woman was eſpouſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not yet married: and ſo by the Law, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, was to be ſtoned, XXII <hi>Deut.</hi> 23, 24. If this ſeem abſurd, that the Adultery of one eſpouſed ſhould be accounted a greater Crime than of one mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried (for <hi>ſtoning</hi> was an heavier puniſhment than <hi>ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>) it ought to be conſidered, that the love of thoſe who were newly eſpouſed, was commonly more fervent than theirs who were married; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the Jews, who for light cauſes were wont to be divorced from their Wives. And therefore no wonder if the Adultery of the former was judged a greater Crime than of the latter.</p>

And there are thoſe who think it may be underſtood of one that had been conſecrated to a falſe Deity; whom ſhe ſerved with the uſe of her Body, which ſhe expoſed to the Worſhippers of that Deity. Who though ſhe afterwards repented, and became good, yet a Prieſt was not to marry her, no more than an ordinary Whore. But the ſimpleſt meaning of theſe <hi>three</hi> ſeems to be, that they ſhould not marry one that had proſtituted her Body, or that had been any way vitiated, though againſt her will; or was of ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chaſtity; or (as it follows) was devorced from her Husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither ſhall they take a Woman put away from her Husband.]</hi> For commonly Women were put away for ſome fault, as <hi>Abarbanel</hi> notes; and were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed not to be ſuch as a Prieſt ſhould deſire.

But this is confuted by <hi>v.</hi> 18. and here it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he only forbids them to accept of any Sacrifice which had the fore-named blemiſhes, from a Gentile. Who might think them not unacceptable, becauſe the Gentiles made no ſcruple to offer ſuch as theſe laſt
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:52830:231"/>mentioned to their Gods; though their Laws, in ſome places, were againſt it. <hi>The Bread of your God:</hi> The Hebrews underſtand hereby to be meant only <hi>Burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings;</hi> which <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſaith were accepted from a Gentile, even <hi>Burnt-offerings</hi> of Birds, though he had not yet renounced Idolatry.

But if he brought ſuch ſpontaneous Offerings as had the fore mentioned blemiſhes, the Prieſt was to reject them (though the Gentiles might ſay they were ſuch as had been accepted by his Gods) or elſe he was to be ſcourged. So this Law is briefly expounded by the Jews when they reckon it up among their Precepts, that <hi>a defective Sacrifice is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, no not from the hand of a Gentile,</hi> as he obſerves in the ſame Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. where he diſcourſes at large on this Subject. And it need not ſeem ſtrange a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſhould bring any ſuch Sacrifices (when their Laws, as I obſerved before, required a choice to be made) for they were not ſo curious in their choice, as the Hebrews; but as <hi>Tertullian</hi> upbraids them ſacrificed <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecta, tabidoſa, &amp; ſcabioſa, Apolog. adv.

               <p>It ſeems more probable that all Nations making great ſhouting, rejoycing, and feaſting in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year, at the firſt New Moon, (as many have obſerved) hoping the reſt of the year, by this means, would prove more proſperous: God was pleaſed to ordain this great rejoycing among his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in honour of himſelf, upon the Day of the firſt New Moon, (which was to be continued every firſt Day of the Month) that he might preſerve them from the Worſhip of the <hi>Moon;</hi> and make them ſenſible that he alone gave them good years, and renewed his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies daily, from Month to Month, upon them. <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frerius</hi> imagines that God put an honour upon this Month, becauſe it was the <hi>ſeventh:</hi> that as every <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day</hi> was a Sabbath, and every <hi>ſeventh year</hi> the Land reſted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo every <hi>ſeventh month</hi> of every year ſhould be a kind of Sabbatical Month; there being more Feaſts in this Month, then in any other Months in the Year.</p>
               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:52830:242"/>
               <p>But all this doth not explain what this blowing of Trumpets was a <hi>memorial</hi> of; which I take to be the Creation of the World; which was in <hi>Autumn.</hi> Upon which account it was, that they anciently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their year at this time, as the Eaſtern People do at this day. They acknowledged alſo God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in bleſſing all the year paſt, and bringing them to the beginning of a new year; which they prayed him to make happy to them.</p>
               <p>They began to blow at Sun-riſe, and continued it till Sun-ſet. He that ſounded the Trumpet began with the uſual Prayer, <hi>Bleſſed be God, who hath ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified us with his Precepts,</hi> &amp;c. ſubjoyning theſe words, <hi>Bleſſed be God, who hath hitherto preſerved us in life, and brought us unto this time.</hi> When all was ended, the People ſaid with a loud voice theſe words of the <hi>Pſalmist,</hi> LXXXIX <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. <hi>Bleſſed is the people that know the joyful ſound: they ſhall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.</hi> See <hi>Buxtorf.

               <p>Such blowing with Trumpets was uſed by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; particularly in the Solemnities they obſerved in honour of <hi>the Mother of the Gods:</hi> One whole day (which was the ſecond) being ſpent in blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Trumpets, as <hi>Julian</hi> tells us in his <hi>fifth Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon this Subject, <gap reason="foreign">

For the Feaſt of Tabernacles fell in the time of Vintage, when the Fruits of the Earth were, in a manner all gathered, XVI <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. From whence it is called by the name of the <hi>Feaſt of Inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings,</hi> XXIII <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. not becauſe the whole Feaſt was celebrated on this account; but becauſe a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of it was kept on this ſcore, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>eighth day;</hi> as the other <hi>ſeven</hi> days were in memory of their dwelling in Tents. But that the <hi>eighth</hi> day had no relation to this, is apparent; for they did not dwell in Tabernacles on the <hi>eighth</hi> day of this Feaſt, but only on the <hi>ſeven</hi> preceding. Which being ended, they returned to their Houſes, and kept this day there to another purpoſe, here named: for ſo it is expreſly ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 42. <hi>Ye ſhall dwell in booths ſeven days.</hi> Which being over, a great Solemnity continued to another purpoſe; and was kept after another manner, not in Booths, but in their Houſes.

For <hi>Gath</hi> ſignifies a Wine-preſs; and therefore they think theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> were ſung in the time of the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Certain it is, that the two laſt named were ſung at ſome great Solemnity, wherein they celebrated God's wonderful Providence over them. And that they uſed to ſing and ſhout at their Vintage, is clear,

               <p>Now this being a time of ſuch great Rejoycing, in both reſpects, it led <hi>Plutarch</hi> into a fancy that the Jews celebrated two Feaſts unto <hi>Bacchus</hi> at this time. For he writes in his <hi>Sympoſiaes, Lib.</hi> IV. <hi>Probl.</hi> 3. That in the midſt of Vintage the Jews ſpread Tables fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all manner of Fruit, and lived in Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, made eſpecially of Palms and Ivy wreathed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and call the day which goes before the Feaſt, <hi>The Day of Tabernacles.</hi> And then a few days after, ſaith he, they keep another Feſtivity, which openly ſhows it was dedicated to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> for they carried Boughs of Palms in their hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with which they went into the Temple, the <hi>Levites</hi> (who he fancies were called ſo from <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Boughs of goodly Trees,</hi> &amp;c.] Some fancy that this is not a direction for the building of Booths with theſe Branches, but for the carrying them in their hands, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, <hi>Lib.</hi> III. <hi>Antiq. cap.</hi> 10. And they ſay theſe Branches were called <hi>Hoſanna's,</hi> becauſe they ſung thoſe words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> as they
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:52830:247"/>marcht along with theſe Boughs in their hands, <hi>Save now</hi> [in the Hebrew the word is <hi>Hoſan-na</hi>] <hi>O LORD: O LORD ſend now proſperity,</hi> CXVIII. 25. And this is ſo riveted in the Minds of the Jews, that <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> makes it the Opinion of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> to hold that they were for any other uſe. But it is evident from VIII <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi> 15. that they cut theſe Branches to make Booths, and not to carry in their hands; though it is likely that this might alſo be thought a fitting Expreſſion of Joy in after times; eſpecially after they were expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of their own Land. It is not unlikely alſo that they celebrated this Feſtival by ſinging of <hi>Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's,</hi> among other tokens of Rejoycing; praying for a happy new year, whoſe Feaſt went a little before on the firſt of this Month. Whence the Rabbins call this Feaſt of Tabernacles by the name of <hi>Hoſanna;</hi> and the laſt day of it they call <hi>Hoſanna Rabba.</hi> And they repeat this often in their Prayers at that time, as they tell us in their <hi>Minhagim</hi> (or Books of <hi>Rituals</hi>) ſaying,
<q>
                     <l>For thy ſake, O our Creator, Hoſanna.</l>
                     <l>For thy ſake, O our Redeemer, Hoſanna.</l>
                     <l>For thy ſake, O our ſeeker, Hoſanna.</l>
                  </q> As if they beſeeched the bleſſed Trinity, <hi>to ſave</hi> them, and <hi>ſend help</hi> to them. In ſhort, they call the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they ſay at this Feaſt, by the name of <hi>Hoſanna's,</hi> as <hi>Joh.

                  <hi>Boughs.]</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Pri</hi> ſignifies <hi>Fruit,</hi> as is noted in the Margin of our Bibles. From whence ſome have gathered that they were to be the Boughs of Fruit-bearing-trees: nay, the Jews fancy they were to be Boughs with their Fruit, as well as Leaves, on
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:52830:248"/>them. But <hi>Buxtorf</hi> made no doubt (in his XVI<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Synag. Judaica</hi>) that the word is rightly tranſlated a <hi>Bough,</hi> whether without Fruit, or with it: though in later Editions of that Book this paſſage be leſt out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goodly Trees.]</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>hadar</hi> doth not meerly ſignifie that which is <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>goodly,</hi> but that which is <hi>large</hi> and <hi>well ſpread;</hi> as is obſerved by <hi>Hottinger</hi> in his <hi>Smegma Orientale, Lib.</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. where he thinks theſe words may be thus exactly tranſlated, <hi>Take to you the Boughs of Trees with broad Leaves, ſuch as the Branches of Palm-trees.</hi> So that <hi>hadar</hi> is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral word, and <hi>Branches of Palm-trees,</hi> a ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Tree with ſpacious Leaves; which were the fitteſt to be uſed, becauſe they were beſt able to defend them, either from heat or cold, or rain. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> takes this word to ſignifie the Boughs of a particular Tree, which he will have to be a <hi>Citron.</hi> And the Jews are ſo poſſeſſed with this opinion, that, at this day, they fancy the Feaſt cannot be celebrated without ſuch Branches. And therefore the Jews now in <hi>Germany</hi> ſend into <hi>Spain,</hi> and endeavour to get one every year with the <hi>Pome-citrons</hi> on it. And after the Feaſt they offer the Citrons to their Friends, as a great preſent. <hi>Hottinger</hi> ſaith he had one preſented to him at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> that very year he wrote his Book now mentioned. See Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> in his <hi>Temple Service, chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3. and <hi>Buxturf. Synag. Jud. cap.</hi> 21.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And Willows of the Brook.]</hi> If this Tranſlation be right, it's likely they ſerved only to twine about the reſt, and bind them together. And therefore in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> VIII. 15. no mention is made of them: their Tabernacles not conſiſting of ſuch Boughs, which were uſed only for the compacting and tying together the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ye ſhall rejoyce before the LORD your God ſeven days.]</hi> Theſe were the ſeven days of the Feaſt of Tabernacles (as I noted before) which were ſpent in Feaſting and other tokens of Joy; with Thanks to God for his great Goodneſs, who had brought them out of the Wilderneſs, where they had no Fig-trees, Vines or Pomegranates, into a Country which abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fruitful Trees of all ſorts. Which was the reaſon, <hi>Maimonides</hi> thinks, that <hi>Moſes</hi> bids them take the Boughs of the moſt <hi>goodly Trees</hi> wherewith to build their Booths, <hi>More Nevoch.

               <p>But of all the Joys at this Feſtival, none was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that of <hi>drawing and pouring out water:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> have this noted ſaying, <hi>He that never ſaw the rejoycing of drawing Water, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw rejoycing in all his life.</hi> The manner of which is deſcribed out of the Jewiſh Writers, by Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> in his <hi>Temple Service, Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. And our bleſſed Saviour is thought to allude to it, when in the <hi>laſt, the great day</hi> of this Feaſt, he cryed, ſaying, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water,</hi> VII <hi>John</hi> 37, 38. But I have not met with any one that gives a tollerable reaſon of this Cuſtom at the Feaſt
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:52830:249"/>of Tabernacles.

And conſequently, this Feaſt was inſtituted to make them ſenſible, how very happy they were in goodly Cities and fine painted Houſes, (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſpeaks in the place above-mentioned) when they came to the good Land promiſed to their Fathers, who wandered

<pb n="492" facs="tcp:52830:253"/>the Shew-bread ſtood was really God's Altar.

                  <hi>And the ſon of an Iſraelitiſh woman, whoſe father was an Egyptian, went out among the Children of</hi> Iſrael.] In the Hebrew the words run thus; <hi>And there went out the ſon of an Iſraelitiſh woman, and he was the ſon of an Egyptian man, in the midst of</hi> (or, <hi>among</hi>) <hi>the Children of</hi> Iſrael.

               <p>The Jews commonly think that this Blaſphemy was his pronouncing the peculiar Name of God; which he heard at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when the Law was given. But this is a meer fancy; for there were ſome reproachful words utter'd againſt God, as well as againſt the Judges,

<pb n="495" facs="tcp:52830:254"/>that God was conſulted about this matter, <hi>becauſe they did not know whether he was to die for this crime; or whether his judgment was to be expected from the hand of Heaven, or otherwiſe.</hi> Whence <hi>Jarchi</hi> ſays, <hi>they did not know whether he was guilty of death or not.</hi> And ſo <hi>Theodoret Q.</hi> XXXIII. in <hi>Lev.</hi> There was no Law, as yet, about this matter.

Some have underſtood the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words, <hi>When ye ſhall come into the Land which I give you,</hi> as if they were to begin the <hi>Sabbatical</hi> year as ſoon as they entred into <hi>Canaan:</hi> which is very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; for ſo, not the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> but the <hi>firſt,</hi> would have been the year of Reſt. And that had been very inconvenient, if not deſtructive; the War making ſuch great waſte, no doubt, that Proviſion would have been very ſcarce, if no care had been taken for the enſuing year. It is to be conſidered alſo, that the old ſtore upon which they lived when they entred into the Land of Promiſe, was the fruit of the labour of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and not of the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The meaning therefore is, that the <hi>ſeventh</hi> year after their entrance into <hi>Canaan,</hi> or rather, after they were ſettled, and had reſt in it, they ſhould let the Land reſt.</p>
               <p>The only queſtion is, When this year was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin? whether in the month of <hi>Tiſri,</hi> (which anſwers to our <hi>September</hi>) which was the ancient beginning of the year; or in <hi>Niſan,</hi> (anſwering to our <hi>March</hi>) which was made a new beginning of it, by an expreſs Law, XII <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. the former ſtill continuing the
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:52830:257"/>beginning of the year for Civil things, as this for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred. Now there is great reaſon to think that this <hi>Sabbatical</hi> year was to commence from <hi>September,</hi> when all their Harveſt was over, which began in <hi>March.</hi> Then they were not to ſow, as they were wont to do in <hi>October</hi> and the following Months; but to ſtay till the return of this Seaſon the next year.

The moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that I meet withal, is, that it was called <hi>Jobel</hi> from the peculiar ſound which was made with the Trumpet, when this year was proclaimed. For the Trumpet blowing for ſeveral purpoſes, <hi>viz.</hi> to call their Aſſemblies together; to give notice of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their Camps; to excite Souldiers to fight, and to proclaim this year; there was a diſtinct ſound for all theſe ends, that People might not be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but have a certain notice what the Trumpet ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. And this ſound mentioned before (<hi>v.</hi> 9.) was peculiarly called <hi>Jobel;</hi> as <hi>Hottinger</hi> thinks, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders a great many other Opinions, in his <hi>Analecta Diſſert.</hi> III. wherein he follows <hi>Joh.

And when it is uſed abſolutely, alone, it ſignifies this year; which was called <hi>Jobel</hi> from that ſound which was then made; as the Feaſt of Unleavened Bread was called <hi>Peſach,</hi> from the Angel paſſing over them, when he ſlew the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> The Opinions of the Hebrew Writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, are collected and largely repreſented by

                  <hi>A Jubile ſhall that fiftieth year be unto you.]</hi> It is a queſtion whether the year of Jubile was the year following the <hi>forty ninth</hi> year; or the <hi>forty ninth</hi> year was the Jubile; which, reckoning the foregoing Jubile for one, was the <hi>fiftieth</hi> year. <hi>Joſephus Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> in his fifth Book <hi>de Emend.

One would have expected therefore that in the <hi>forty eighth</hi> year there ſhould have been a ſpecial Promiſe, that the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:52830:262"/>Land ſhould bring forth Fruit for <hi>four</hi> years, and not for <hi>three</hi> only; as the Bleſſing is promiſed every <hi>ſixth</hi> year, <hi>v.</hi> 21. Thus <hi>Jacobus Capellus</hi> reaſons in his <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoria Sacra &amp; Exotica ad A. M.</hi> 2549. But others think this Objection not to be ſo great as to make them depart from the letter of this Law, which ſaith <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Ye ſhall hallow the fiftieth year:</hi> and here in this Verſe, <hi>A Jubile ſhall that fiftieth year be unto you.</hi> Though a very learned Man, <hi>P.

Which makes for their opinion who think the Jubile was not the ſame with that, but a new Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batical year: ſo that two years together they neither ſowed nor reaped. But they that maintain the other
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:52830:262"/>opinion, look upon this only as a new reaſon why they ſhould forbear ſuch labour this year; becauſe, beſides that it was the Sabbatical year, it was alſo the Jubile: a time of great joy, in regard of the Liberty to which every one was reſtored; which made it more neceſſary every one ſhould enjoy what the Earth brought forth of it ſelf, and none appropriate any thing to themſelves.</p>

Whence thoſe words of <hi>Maimonides</hi> in the Treatiſe I have ſo often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>ſect.</hi> 16.
<q>In this the Sabbatical year excels the Jubile, that it remits Debts, which the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile doth not: But the Jubile in this excels the Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical year, that it ſets Servants free, and reſtores Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, which the other doth not. And the Jubile likewiſe reſtores Poſſeſſions in the very beginning of the year: but the Sabbatical year doth not releaſe Debts till it be ended.</q>

For it was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:52830:263"/>that the Heathens themſelves took notice of it: inſomuch that <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lib.</hi> XI. it was not lawful for the Jews <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to ſell their own Inheritances. Meaning, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it (<hi>Lib. de Succeſſ. ad Leges Hebr. cap.</hi> 14.) to ſell them quite, ſo as to alienate them for ever from their Families; which is expreſly forbidden <hi>v.</hi> 23. And ſo the <hi>Locrians,</hi> as is obſerved by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Politicks,</hi> were prohibited by their Laws to ſell their ancient Poſſeſſions. See <hi>P. Cunaeus Lib.</hi> I. <hi>de Repub. Jud. cap.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Many Reaſons are given by learned Men for this Law among the Jews, (See <hi>Menochius Lib.</hi> III. <hi>de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub. Hebraeor. Quaeſt.</hi> 3.) The moſt obvious is, that by this Law God fixed the Jews to the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> ſince all their Poſſeſſions were ſo entailed, that the right Heir of any of them could never be wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from his Eſtate; but it would intirely return to him after a certain number of years. And by this means alſo they preſerved a diſtinct knowledge of their ſeveral Tribes and Families to which they belonged: for which end their Genealogies were of neceſſity to be carefully kept, that they might be able to prove their right to the Inheritance of their Anceſtors. By which means, as <hi>Menochius</hi> notes, it was certainly known of what Tribe and Family the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was when he was born. And M. <hi>Alix</hi> hath taken notice (which is worth obſerving) that God ordered things ſo, that they ſhould have the means of preſerving their Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, by not ſuffering them to continue in Captivity out of their own Land, for the ſpace of two whole Jubiles. For they were but LXX years in <hi>Babylon;</hi> in which ſhort time their Genealogies could not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily confounded; eſpecially ſince ſeveral who ſaw the firſt Temple burnt, lived to ſee the ſecond begin to be
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:52830:263"/>rebuilt. Two other Reaſons are moſt judiciouſly managed by <hi>Petrus Cunaeus, Lib.</hi> I. <hi>de Republ. Hebr. cap.</hi> 3. to which I refer the learned Reader.</p>

The Hebrew Doctors have formed a Rule about this: that if a Man bought any thing for a <hi>ſixth</hi> part leſs than its worth, or ſold it for a <hi>ſixth</hi> part more than its worth, he was bound to reſtore that <hi>ſixth</hi> part: but nothing at all if it were ſhort of a <hi>ſixth</hi> part, wherein he had damaged his Neighbour.

               <p>The Hebrew word <hi>Elilim,</hi> hath been obſerved before XIX. 4. to expreſs Contempt: ſignifying the <hi>Idols</hi> (as we tranſlate it) which the Heathen worſhipped, to be meer empty Vanities, <hi>things of nought,</hi> as we ſpeak; and therefore to be rejected with diſdain, rather than any way regarded.</p>

Theſe Images the Gentiles did not Worſhip, till they were dedicated and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated with certain Rites and Ceremonies, (which were very various, according to the difference of the Deities, and the Superſtitions of ſeveral Countries) by which Conſecration they imagined their Gods were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:52830:275"/>to be preſent in theſe Images and Statues: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they were not ſo ſtupid, as to worſhip Wood and Stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither rear up a ſtanding Image.]</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Matſebah</hi> is tranſlated by the LXX. <gap reason="foreign">

Theſe were the moſt ancient Monuments of all other; and being plain and ſimple, might be thought to be leſs tempting and inviting, than thoſe Images which had the figure of Men, or other Creatures: yet even theſe God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids to his People, becauſe he would have no Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of him whatſoever; though it might ſeem to have no danger in it.

               <p>
                  <hi>Neither ſet up any Image of Stone in your Land.]</hi> There was greater reaſon they ſhould not ſet up <hi>Eben Maſchkith,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>carved or figured</hi> Stone that had Pictures cut in it, as the Hebrews underſtand it.

<pb n="537" facs="tcp:52830:275"/>alſo it was unlawful to ſet up theſe <hi>in their Land</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſpeaks) though it were without the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and it was no more permitted to a <hi>Proſelyte,</hi> then to an <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> If any Man did make ſuch Statues he was beaten.</p>
               <p>Poſſibly this may ſignifie ſuch Images, as were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in after times; which were not Repreſentations of their Gods, but were full of <hi>Symbols</hi> and <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> expreſſing ſome of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of their Gods.

                  </q> We do not expreſly read indeed of this profane neglect, while they dwelt in their Land: but
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:52830:285"/>
                  <hi>Jeremiah</hi> complains that they did not in his time give their Servants Liberty in the <hi>ſeventh</hi> year, (XXXIV. 17.) and he gives this as one reaſon why God delivered them up to Slavery, (for ſo I underſtand thoſe words I <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. <hi>Judah is gone into captivity, becauſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and becauſe of great ſervitude.</hi>) And from thence we may conclude that the ſame covetous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour (and diſtruſt of God's Providence) made them not ſuffer their Land to reſt in that year. Eſpecially ſince the Author of the ſecond Book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mentions this as a reaſon of their Captivity, <hi>to fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of</hi> Jeremiah <hi>the Prophet, until the Land had enjoyed her Sabbaths: for as long as ſhe lay deſolate ſhe kept Sabbath, to fulfil threeſcore and ten years,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXXVI. 21.

                  <hi>None devoted, which ſhall be devoted of men, ſhall be redeemed, but ſhall ſurely be put to death.]</hi> Some learned Men have, from theſe words, aſſerted, That Parents and Maſters among the Jews, had ſuch a power over their Children and Servants, that they might devote them to Death, and ſo kill them; only the Sentence of the Prieſt was to concur, to whom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very devoted thing fell, as his portion. This is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>Ludov. Capellus,</hi> and confuted by Mr. <hi>Selden, Lib.</hi> IV. <hi>de Jure Nat. &amp; Gent. juxta Diſciplin. Hebr. cap.</hi> 6. where he judiciouſly obſerves, That this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would have too much intrenched upon the <hi>ſixth Commandment,</hi> if private Men might have, at their
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:52830:295"/>pleaſure, thus diſpoſed of their Children and Slaves. And in the next Chapter he explains the ſenſe of this Verſe; and proves indeed that there may be a <hi>Cherem (minhaadam) of men,</hi> or <hi>from among men,</hi> as well as of <hi>beaſts;</hi> but this word hath four ſeveral ſenſes among the <hi>Hebrews. First,</hi> It ſignifies the Sacred Gift it ſelf, which was devoted to God, or to holy Uſes; and ſo it ſignifies in the foregoing <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It ſignifies that which was devoted to Perdition and utter Deſtruction; either by the right of War, or upon the account of Capital Enmities: an Example of which we have in <hi>Jericho,</hi> VI <hi>Joſh.</hi> 17. where the whole City was a <hi>Cherem</hi> (devoted to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction) as a Puniſhment to their Enemies: yet ſo that the Metals were made a <hi>Cherem</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> ſort; that is, Sacred to the LORD and his Holy Uſes. And thus the great <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> (called in Scripture <hi>the whole Congregation</hi>) might devote thoſe to be a <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> who going to the Wars, did not obey orders, and perform the Charge laid upon them. An Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of which we have XXI <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> XIV. 24. I omit the other <hi>two</hi> for brevities ſake, (of which there are Examples VI. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 26. X <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. XXIII <hi>Acts</hi> 12, 14, 21. See <hi>Selden. Ib. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.) becauſe the <hi>Cherem</hi> here mentioned by <hi>Moſes</hi> is of this <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort. For it is evident that the <hi>Cherem</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> ſort, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>v.</hi> 28. was of ſuch things, over which they had an intire power, to diſpoſe of them as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And therefore thoſe words, <hi>both of Man and Beast,</hi> the Hebrews underſtand of their <hi>Slaves,</hi> whether Men or Women (who were <hi>Canaanites</hi> or Gentiles, not others) who were in their power as much as their <hi>Beaſts,</hi> to give away, or to ſell. But to take away their Life, or to give them to be ſlain, was not in
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:52830:296"/>their power: but all the effect of this <hi>Cherem</hi> was, that the whole right which they had to the Service of ſuch Slaves, was transferred, by him that devoted them, to the Service of the Prieſts, and Sacred Uſes. See <hi>Selden</hi> in that Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 518, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But though they might not devote their Servants to death, yet they might their Enemies, before they went out to war with them; and ſuch of their own People al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as did not obſerve the Military Laws. An Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of which we have XXI <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.

And this is the <hi>Cherem</hi> ſpoken of in this Verſe. See <hi>Selden cap.</hi> 10. For as for the <hi>Cherem</hi> whereby a Man was Excommunicated, it only loaded him with many Curſes, and made him execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo that no Man might come near him; but did not touch his Life, as he there ſhows, <hi>p.</hi> 520.</p>

Which was the intention of paying Tithes; as the Gentiles anciently did, and the Jews themſelves, after Victory over their Enemies. For which there being no Precept that appears, what can we think, but that natural Reaſon, and the common Cuſtom of
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:52830:296"/>Mankind (founded perhaps upon ſome direction gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to our firſt Parents from above) taught them to make this Acknowledgment to God, as the Author of their Succeſſes and Safety, as well as of all Plenty and Proſperity.

                  <hi>And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he ſhall add thereto the fifth part thereof.]</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of Tithes,</hi> Chap. 2. ſpeaking of the <hi>ſecond Tithe</hi> mentioned XIV <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. which was to be ſpent at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (either in kind, or elſe if it were too far thither, by turning it into Money, and therewith to buy Proviſion to make Feaſts) ſaith, <hi>that to this Tithe do the Jews apply that of</hi> XXVII <hi>Lev.</hi> 30, 31. But for this he quotes only <hi>R. S. Jarchi:</hi> who, though he were a great <hi>Talmudist,</hi> yet muſt not
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:52830:297"/>be thought to underſtand the ſenſe of all their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> it is plain (to name no more) takes it otherwiſe; making <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſpeak of ſuch a Tithe as <hi>Abraham</hi> gave <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> vowed to God. <hi>Lyra,</hi> I might add, a converted Jew, agrees with him. And there is great reaſon for it; no ſuch thing as a <hi>ſecond Tithe</hi> being as yet ordained: and when they were commanded, and the changing of them into Money allowed, there is not a word ſaid of <hi>adding a fifth part,</hi> (See XIV <hi>Deut.</hi> 24, 25.) which is ſufficient to ſhow that <hi>Moſes,</hi> in theſe two Verſes, ſpeaks of the <hi>first Tithe,</hi> which was paid to the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> by a Law made ſome time after this; which transferred the right that God had <hi>in the Tithe of the Land,</hi> unto them. Which if any Man had a mind to <hi>redeem,</hi> and not pay it in kind, God allows him ſo to do; becauſe the Tithe was not more holy than things vowed to God, ſpoken of before: but then he was to do, as in the caſe of ſuch things, (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) add a <hi>fifth part,</hi> over and above, to what ſuch a portion of Tithe was eſteemed to be worth. The reaſon of which was, as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> well obſerves, not that the Prieſt ſhould get more than his due by the Man who deſired to redeem his Tithe; but that the Man might not make a gain of the Prieſt. For it is ſeldom ſeen that a Husbandman deſires to pay Money, rather than his Tithe; unleſs he propound ſome conſiderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to himſelf.</p>

For this was the Tithe of thoſe young ones that were brought forth that year; the ſame Cattle not being again tithed
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:52830:297"/>every year. And he ſpeaks of clean Beaſts, which were allowed in Sacrifice; for Tithe was not paid of other Beaſts; but their firſt-born only was the LORD's.

                  <hi>Even of whatſoever paſſeth under the rod.]</hi> This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the manner of this Tithing; which, if we will believe the Jews, was thus: They were all brought into a Sheep-cote, (ſaith <hi>Maimonides</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of Firſtborn, cap.</hi> 7. in the beginning) in which there was but one Gate or Door, and that ſo narrow, as to ſuffer no more than one to come out at once. Their Dams being placed without, and the Gate opened, the young ones were invited by their Bleatings, to preſs to get out to them: and as they paſſed by, one by one, a Man who ſtood at the Gate with a Rod, coloured with Oker, told them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and when the Tenth came out, whether it was Male or Female, ſound or not, he markt it with his Rod, and ſaid, <hi>Let this be holy in the name of the Tenth.</hi> And this account <hi>R. Solomon,</hi> and others, give of this matter: of which Notion they are ſo fond, that <hi>R. Bechai</hi> (upon XVII <hi>Numb.</hi>) makes <hi>Jacob</hi> (who vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tithe of all that God ſhould give him) to have decimated his Children on this manner, beginning at <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and ſtopping at <hi>Levi,</hi> who was the Tenth, according to that reckoning: and hath ſome pretty conceits about it. But <hi>Bochartus</hi> thinks <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not ſpeak here of the Rod of the Tithes, but of the Shepherd's Crook; and ſo doth <hi>Aben-Ezra,</hi> the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack</hi> and the <hi>Vulgar:</hi> For the Flock paſſed under his Rod, as oft as he numbred them: which was every Morning and Evening (if he was a good Shepherd)
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:52830:298"/>eſpecially in the Evening. See <hi>Hierozoicon P.</hi> I. <hi>Lib.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 44. <hi>p.</hi> 499.

                  <hi>The tenth ſhall be holy unto the LORD.]</hi> That is, ſaith <hi>Maimonides</hi> (in his forenamed Treatiſe called <hi>Bechoroth</hi>) the Fat and the Blood of them was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Altar; and then the Owners eat the Fleſh any where in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as they did the leſſer holy things. For the Prieſts had no portion of them, but all belonged to the Owner; as did the Paſchal Lamb. If there was any Blemiſh in them, whether before or after the Tithing, then they might be eaten in any place. And ſo <hi>Bartenora</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Owtram</hi> obſerves, <hi>Lib.</hi> I. <hi>de Sacrificiis, cap.</hi> 11.) <hi>we do not find in the whole Law, that any part of theſe Tenths was given to the Prieſts.</hi> So a great many other of their Doctors, who obſerve that <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not reckon theſe among the XXIV. <hi>Gifts</hi> (for ſo many they make the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them) which were beſtowed upon the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But, as there is nothing elſe in Scripture to warrant this, which no where preſcribes how theſe <hi>Tenths</hi> ſhould be imployed, but only declares that they are <hi>holy to the LORD;</hi> ſo this very Phraſe, I ſhould think, ſufficiently ſignifies that they belonged to the LORD's Miniſters. And if not intirely to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> much leſs intirely to the Owners of them (before they were the LORD's) but if they were to eat them at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the Jews imagine, the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Which Laws ought not to be paſſed over, without ſerious conſideration how far we may be concerned in them. And therefore to make what I have noted about them, more uſeful to us in theſe days, I deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> to obſerve, That the very ſame pious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations have ever been in all good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſuppoſes (in the former part of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) would be in the <hi>Jews,</hi> to devote ſome part of their Goods, their Houſes, or Lands to the Service of God: which became ſacred things, and were to be imployed to no other uſe but that. The very firſt Chriſtians had ſo much of this Spirit in them, that they ſold all their Poſſeſſions, and Goods, and let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that needed have a ſhare of them (II <hi>Acts</hi> 45. IV. 35.) becauſe the whole number of Believers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to nothing elſe, but the Service of Chriſt; and the Apoſtles alſo were to be furniſhed with means, to go and propagate the Goſpel in all the World. Where, as ſoon as the Chriſtian Religion prevailed in any place, immediately there were the like volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Oblations made, in ſuch a proportion, as ſerved not only for the ſupport of the Service of God in that Church, but helpt to maintain the Chriſtians at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who had been brought low by parting with their Eſtates, to further the firſt preaching of the Goſpel. This we find in a great number of places: but it may ſuffice to ſay, that the Feaſts of Charity were maintained out of theſe Oblations.</p>
               <pb n="585" facs="tcp:52830:299"/>
               <p>By which it is apparent, that they took themſelves to have the very ſame Obligations upon them in this matter, which the Jews formerly had: and therefore it is no wonder that <hi>Tithes</hi> came in time to be devoted for the maintenance of God's Miniſters. For it is ſenſleſs to imagine that the Goſpel which conſtrained them to give up themſelves to God, ſhould not conſtrain them, with the ſame freedom of mind to give ſome of their Goods (as <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſuppoſes the Jews would do) for the maintenance of his Service. And it is as unreaſonable to think, it did not move them to give the Miniſters of God as honourable a maintenance, as had been allowed under the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which required beſides the <hi>Tenth</hi> here mentioned, another Tithe of the remainder, to be ſpent in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of which the <hi>Levites</hi> had their ſhare, as I obſerved from XIV <hi>Deut.</hi> 22, 28. To which if we add the Firſt-born, with all Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the Prieſts ſhare of Peace-offerings, and the Skins of the Sacrifices, (which alone made a good Revenue, as <hi>Philo</hi> obſerves) and likewiſe all ſuch Conſecrations as are mentioned in this Chapter, the <hi>Levites</hi> Cities and Suburbs; it will eaſily appear it could not be ſo little as a <hi>fifth</hi> part of the Fruit of the Land which came to their ſhare.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon we find no ſuch certain Rate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Goſpel, as was by this Law, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no need of it. And for the ſame reaſon there was none, for a good while, ſettled by the Church: all the Revenues belonging to it, which ſerved for all ſort of pious uſes, ariſing from the Devotion and Oblations of the People, which were more then enough for God's Service. This
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:52830:300"/>was viſible in the beginning of our Religion, when the firſt Chriſtians far out-did any thing that had been done under the Law. And they could not imagine, that they who ſucceeded them would fall ſo ſhort as not to offer ſufficient for God's Service; though not ſo much as they had done, becauſe there could not be the ſame neceſſity. And ſo Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> himſelf obſerves, that this reaſon is given by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobardus</hi> why nothing was decreed in Councils, or publickly promulgated by the Fathers in the firſt Ages, concerning giving of their Goods, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches, becauſe there was no neceſſity of it; the Religious Devotion, and Love of Chriſtians to ſuch things <hi>ultro aeſtuante,</hi> being very fervent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding of its own accord.</p>
               <p>And when Love began to wax cold, ſo that they found it needful to make Laws about ſuch things, they could not think fit to order leſs for the ſettled Maintenance of God's Service then the <hi>Tenth,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all voluntary Oblations) which had been the part moſt eminently limited under the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, long before the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> See <hi>Irenaeus Lib.</hi> IV. <hi>cap.</hi> 34. where, he ſaith, Chriſtians, having greater hopes, could not give leſs then they did in former times, when their hope was lower.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add but one Obſervation more, from an excellent Perſon of our own Church (Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> in his <hi>Rights of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 219.) that as all ſuch Conſecrations, as here are mentioned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> tended to Communion with God, by the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacrifices offered to him; which were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſuch Contributions: ſo whatſoever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted by Chriſtians unto ſuch holy uſes, as to build and repair Churches, to maintain holy Aſſemblies,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:52830:300"/>and to ſupport thoſe who miniſter God's Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or enable the Poor to attend upon them, hath the like intention; to obtain an intereſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt, repreſented in the Euchariſt; which is the chief part of the Service rendered to God in the Church. This is notably exemplified in the account which <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives of <hi>Marcion</hi> the Heretick, (<hi>Lib. de Praeſcriptionibus, cap.</hi> 30.) who when he firſt embraced the Faith of Chriſt, and was received into the Church, <hi>pecuniam Catholicae Eccleſiae contulit,</hi> contributed a Sum of Money to the Church: which Money, when he fell off from the Chriſtian Truth to his own Hereſie, was ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thrown out together with him. This both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates that they continued, in thoſe days, to bring Offerings into the Treaſury of the Church; and that the intention of them was, that they might have Communion with the Church in all its Services: for when Men fell off from Chriſtianity, they caſt out their Offerings, in token they had no Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them.</p>

For the Law of Charity dictates this, and the excellent, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Ordinance of God. Which Charity binds
